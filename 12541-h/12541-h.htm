<h2>I. THE BATTLE OF PEA RIDGE, OR ELKHORN, AND ITS MORE IMMEDIATE
EFFECTS</h2>
<p>The Indian alliance, so assiduously sought by the Southern
Confederacy and so laboriously built up, soon revealed itself to be
most unstable. Direct and unmistakable signs of its instability
appeared in connection with the first real military test to which
it was subjected, the Battle of Pea Ridge or Elkhorn, as it is
better known in the South, the battle that stands out in the
history of the War of Secession as being the most decisive victory
to date of the Union forces in the West and as marking the turning
point in the political relationship of the State of Missouri with
the Confederate government.</p>
<p>In the short time during which, following the removal of General
Fr&eacute;mont, General David Hunter was in full command of the
Department of the West&mdash;and it was practically not more than
one week&mdash;he completely reversed the policy of vigorous
offensive that had obtained under men, subordinate to his
predecessor.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> In southwest Missouri, he abandoned
the advanced position of the Federals and fell back upon Sedalia
and Rolla, railway termini. That he did this at the suggestion of
President Lincoln<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> and with
the tacit approval of General McClellan<a id="footnotetag3" name=

<p>difference now, as it made no difference then, in the
consideration of the consequences; yet the consequences were, none
the less, rather serious. They were such, in fact, as to increase
very greatly the confusion on the border and to give the
Confederates that chance of recovery which soon made it necessary
for their foes to do the work of Nathaniel Lyon all over again.</p>
<p>It has been most truthfully said<a id="footnotetag4" name=
"footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> that
never, throughout the period of the entire war, did the southern
government fully realize the surpassingly great importance of its
Trans-Mississippi District; notwithstanding that when that district
was originally organized,<a id="footnotetag5" name=
"footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> in
January, 1862, some faint idea of what it might, peradventure,
accomplish did seem to penetrate,<a id="footnotetag6" name=
"footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> although
ever so vaguely, the minds of those then in authority. It was
organized under pressure from the West as was natural, and under
circumstances to which meagre and tentative reference has already
been made in the first volume of this work.<a id="footnotetag7"
name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> In
the main, the circumstances were such as developed out of the
persistent refusal of General McCulloch to co&ouml;perate with
General Price.</p>
<p>There was much to be said in justification of McCulloch's
obstinacy. To understand this it is well to recall that, under the
plan, lying back of this first</p>

<p>It is doubtful if even this ought to be conceded in view of the
fact that President Davis later admitted that Van Dorn entered upon
the Pea Ridge campaign for the sole purpose of effecting "a
diversion in behalf of General Johnston" [<i>Rise and Fall of the
Confederate Government</i>, vol. ii, 51]. Moreover, Van Dorn had
scarcely been assigned to the command of the Trans-Mississippi
District before Beauregard was devising plans for bringing him east
again [Greene, <i>The Mississippi</i>, II; Roman, <i>Military
Operations of General Beauregard</i>, vol. i, 240-244].</p>

<p>appointment to the Confederate command, was the expectation that
he would secure the Indian Territory. Obviously, the best way to do
that was to occupy it, provided the tribes, whose domicile it was,
were willing. But, if the Cherokees can be taken to have voiced the
opinion of all, they were not willing, notwithstanding that a
sensationally reported<a id="footnotetag8" name=
"footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> Federal
activity under Colonel James Montgomery,<a id="footnotetag9" name=
"footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> in the
neighborhood of the frontier posts, Cobb, Arbuckle, and Washita,
was designed to alarm them and had notably influenced, if it had
not actually inspired, the selection and appointment of the Texan
ranger.<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href=
"#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Unable, by reason of the Cherokee objection thereto, to enter
the Indian country; because entrance in the face of that objection
would inevitably force the Ross faction of the Cherokees and,
possibly also, Indians of other tribes into the arms of the Union,
McCulloch intrenched himself on its northeast border, in Arkansas,
and there awaited a more favorable opportunity for accomplishing
his main purpose. He seems to have desired the Confederate
government to add the contiguous portion of Arkansas to his
command, but in that he was disappointed.<a id="footnotetag11"
name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>
Nevertheless, Arkansas early interpreted his presence in the state
to imply that he was there primarily for her defence and, by the
middle of June, that idea had so far gained general acceptance that
C.C. Danley, speaking for the Arkansas Military Board, urged
President Davis "to meet</p>

<p>the exigent necessities of the State" by sending a second
general officer there, who should command in the northeastern
part.<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href=
"#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>McCulloch's relations with leading Confederates in Arkansas seem
to have been, from the first, in the highest degree friendly, even
cordial, and it is more than likely that, aside from his
unwillingness to offend the neutrality-loving Cherokees, the best
explanation for his eventual readiness to make the defence of
Arkansas his chief concern, instead of merely a means to the
accomplishment of his original task, may be found in that fact. On
the twenty-second of May, the Arkansas State Convention instructed
Brigadier-general N. Bart Pearce, then in command of the state
troops, to co&ouml;perate with the Confederate commander "to the
full extent of his ability"<a id="footnotetag13" name=
"footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> and, on
the twenty-eighth of the same month, the Arkansas Military Board
invited that same person, who, of course, was Ben McCulloch, to
assume command himself of the Arkansas local forces.<a id=
"footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href=
"#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> Sympathetic understanding of this
variety, so early established, was bound to produce good results
and McCulloch henceforth identified himself most thoroughly with
Confederate interests in the state in which he was, by dint of
untoward circumstances, obliged to bide his time.</p>
<p>It was far otherwise as respected relations between McCulloch
and the Missouri leaders. McCulloch had little or no tolerance for
the rough-and-ready methods of men like Claiborne Jackson and
Sterling Price. He regarded their plans as impractical, chimerical,
and their warfare as after the guerrilla order, too much like</p>

<p>that to which Missourians and Kansans had accustomed themselves
during the period of border conflict, following the passage of the
Kansas-Nebraska Bill. McCulloch himself was a man of system. He
believed in organization that made for efficiency. Just prior to
the Battle of Wilson's Creek, he put himself on record as strongly
opposed to allowing unarmed men and camp followers to infest his
ranks, demoralizing them.<a id="footnotetag15" name=
"footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> It was
not to be expected, therefore, that there could ever be much in
common between him and Sterling Price. For a brief period, it is
true, the two men did apparently act in fullest harmony; but it was
when the safety of Price's own state, Missouri, was the thing
directly in hand. That was in early August of 1861. Price put
himself and his command subject to McCulloch's orders.<a id=
"footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href=
"#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> The result was the successful
engagement, August 10 at Wilson's Creek, on Missouri soil. On the
fourteenth of the same month, Price reassumed control of the
Missouri State Guard<a id="footnotetag17" name=
"footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> and,
from that time on, he and McCulloch drifted farther and farther
apart; but, as their aims were so entirely different, it was not to
be wondered at.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, all would have been well had McCulloch been
disposed to make the defence of Missouri his only aim. Magnanimity
was asked of him such as the Missouri leaders never so much as
contemplated showing in return. It seems never to have occurred to
either Jackson or Price that co&ouml;peration might, perchance,
involve such an exchange of courtesies as would require Price to
lend a hand in some project that McCulloch might devise for the
well-being of his own particular</p>

<p>charge. The assistance was eventually asked for and refused,
refused upon the ground, familiar in United States history, that it
would be impossible to get the Missouri troops to cross the state
line. Of course, Price's conduct was not without extenuation. His
position was not identical with McCulloch's. His force was a state
force, McCulloch's a Confederate, or a national. Besides, Missouri
had yet to be gained, officially, for the Confederacy. She expected
secession states and the Confederacy itself to force the situation
for her. And, furthermore, she was in far greater danger of
invasion than was Arkansas. The Kansans were her implacable and
dreaded foes and Arkansas had none like them to fear.</p>
<p>In reality, the seat of all the trouble between McCulloch and
Price lay in particularism, a phase of state rights, and, in its
last analysis, provincialism. Now particularism was especially
pronounced and especially pernicious in the middle southwest.
Missouri had always more than her share of it. Her politicians were
impregnated by it. They were interested in their own locality
exclusively and seemed quite incapable of taking any broad survey
of events that did not immediately affect themselves or their own
limited concerns. In the issue between McCulloch and Price, this
was all too apparent. The politicians complained unceasingly of
McCulloch's neglect of Missouri and, finally, taking their case to
headquarters, represented to President Davis that the best
interests of the Confederate cause in their state were being
glaringly sacrificed by McCulloch's too literal interpretation of
his official instructions, in the strict observance of which he was
keeping close to the Indian boundary.</p>
<p>President Davis had personally no great liking for</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg
19]</span>
<p>Price and certainly none for his peculiar method of fighting.
Some people thought him greatly prejudiced<a id="footnotetag18"
name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>
against Price and, in the first instance, perhaps, on nothing more
substantial than the fact that Price was not a Westpointer.<a id=
"footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href=
"#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> It would be nearer the truth to say
that Davis gauged the western situation pretty accurately and knew
where the source of trouble lay. That he did gauge the situation
and that accurately is indicated by a suggestion of his, made in
early December, for sending out Colonel Henry Heth of Virginia to
command the Arkansas and Missouri divisions in combination.<a id=
"footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href=
"#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a> Heth had no local attachments in
the region and "had not been connected with any of the troops on
that line of operations."<a id="footnotetag21" name=
"footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>
Unfortunately, for subsequent events his nomination<a id=
"footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href=
"#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a> was not confirmed.</p>
<p>Two days later, December 5, 1861, General McCulloch was
granted<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a><a href=
"#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a> permission to proceed to Richmond,
there to explain in person, as he had long wanted to do, all
matters in controversy between him and Price. On the third of
January, 1862, the Confederate Congress called<a id="footnotetag24"
name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>
for information on the subject, doubtless under pressure of

<p>superseded by that which later clothed Van Dorn and yet his
department was now to be absorbed by a military district, which was
itself merely a section of another department. The name and
organization of the Department of Indian Territory remained to
breed confusion, disorder, and serious discontent at a slightly
subsequent time. Of course, since the ratification of the treaties
of alliance with the tribes, there was no question to be raised
concerning the status of Indian Territory as definitely a
possession of the Southern Confederacy. Indeed, it had, in a way,
been counted as such, actual and prospective, ever since the
enactment of the marque and reprisal law of May 6, 1861.<a id=

his new duties. There was much to be attended to before he could
proceed west. His appointment had come and had been accepted in
November. Christmas was now near at hand and he had yet to render
an account of his mission of treaty-making. In late December, he
sent in his official report<a id="footnotetag32" name=

respond to any interpellating call that the Provincial Congress
might see fit to make. The intervals of time, free from devotion to
the completion of the older task, were spent by him in close
attention to the preliminary details of the newer, in securing
funds and in purchasing supplies and equipment</p>

save to that Confederacy the Indian Territory. The Indian occupants
in and for themselves, unflattering as it may seem to them for
historical investigators to have to admit it, were not objects of
his solicitude except in so far as they contributed to his real and
ultimate endeavor. He never at any time or under any circumstances
advocated their use generally as soldiers outside of Indian
Territory in regular campaign work and offensively.<a id=

<p>The provision in the treaties to the effect that the alliance
consummated between the Indians and the Confederate government was
to be both offensive and defensive must not be taken too literally
or be construed so broadly as to militate against this fact: for to
its truth Pike, when in distress later on and accused of leading a
horde of tomahawking villains, repeatedly bore witness. The keeping
back of a foe, bent upon regaining Indian Territory or of
marauding, might well be said to partake of the character of
offensive warfare and yet not be that in intent or in the ordinary
acceptation of the term. Everything would have to depend upon the
point of view.</p>

<p>A restricted use of the Indians in offensive guerrilla action
Pike would doubtless have permitted and justified. Indeed, he seems
even to have recommended it in the first days of his interest in
the subject of securing Indian Territory. No other interpretation
can possibly be given to his suggestion that a battalion be raised
from Indians that more strictly belonged to Kansas [<i>Official
Records</i>, vol. iii, 581]. It is also conceivable that the force
he had reference to in his letter to Benjamin, November 27, 1861

Indian troops, however and wherever raised under the provisions of

performing their function as a home guard, they should have to
cross their own boundary in order to expel or to punish an
intruder, well and good; but their intrinsic character as something
resembling a police patrol could not be deemed thereby affected.
Moreover, Pike did not believe that acting alone they could even be
a thoroughly adequate home force. He, therefore, urged again and
again that their contingent should be supplemented by a white force
and by one sufficiently large to give dignity and poise and

conduct a spring campaign in the latter state, "to attempt St.

ulterior motive may have been and, in the light of subsequent
events, probably was, to effect a diversion for General A.S.
Johnston; but, if that were really so, it was not, at the time,
divulged or so much as hinted at.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the great object that Van Dorn had in mind was the
relief of Missouri. And he may have dreamed, that feat
accomplished, that it would be possible to carry the war into the
enemy's country beyond the Ohio; but, alas, it was his misfortune
at this juncture to be called upon to realise, to his great
discomfiture, the truth of Robert Burns' homely philosophy,</p>

via Springfield into northwestern Arkansas and were driving before
them the Confederates under McCulloch and Price.</p>
<p>The Federal forces comprised four huge divisions and were led by
Brigadier-general Samuel R. Curtis. Towards the end of the previous

guarding the Mississippi River [<i>ibid</i>., 786]. By the middle
of February, or thereabouts, Price and McCulloch were in desperate
straits and were steadily "falling back before a superior force to
the Boston Mountains" [<i>ibid</i>., 787].</p>

Department of the West, of which Fr&eacute;mont had had charge and
subsequently Hunter, but for only a brief period, had been
reorganized and divided into two distinct departments, the
Department of Missouri with Halleck in command and the Department
of Kansas with Hunter. Curtis, at the time when he made his
memorable advance movement from Rolla was, therefore, serving under
Halleck.</p>
<p>In furtherance of Van Dorn's original plan, General Pike had
been ordered to march with all speed and join forces with the main
army. At the time of the issuance of the order, he seems to have
offered no objections to taking his Indians out of their own
territory. Disaster had not yet overtaken them or him and he had
not yet met with the injustice that was afterwards his regular lot.
If his were regarded as more or less of a puppet command, he was
not yet aware of it and, oblivious of all scorn felt for Indian
soldiers, kept his eye single on the assistance he was to render in
the accomplishment of Van Dorn's object. It was anything but easy,
however, for him to move with dispatch. He had difficulty in
getting such of his brigade as was Indian and as had collected at
Cantonment Davis, a Choctaw and Chickasaw battalion and the First
Creek Regiment, to stir. They had not been paid their money and had
not been furnished with arms and clothing as promised. Pike had the
necessary funds with him, but time would be needed in which to
distribute them, and the order had been for him to move promptly.
It was something much more easily said than done. Nevertheless, he
did what he could, paid outright the Choctaws and Chickasaws, a
performance that occupied</p>

one day, expecting there to be overtaken by additional Choctaws and

not appear, he went forward towards Evansville and upward to
Cincinnati, a small town on the Arkansas side of the Cherokee line.

of March 27, 1862, it published the following in bitter
sarcasm:</p>
<p>"The Albert Pike who led the Aboriginal Corps of Tomahawkers and
Scalpers at the battle of Pea Ridge, formerly kept school in
Fairhaven, Mass., where he was indicted for playing the part of
Squeers, and cruelly beating and starving a boy in his family. He
escaped by some hocus-pocus law, and emigrated to the West, where
the violence of his nature has been admirably enhanced. As his name
indicates, he is a ferocious fish, and has fought duels enough to
qualify himself to be a leader of savages. We suppose that upon the
recent occasion, he got himself up in good style, war-paint,
nose-ring, and all. This new Pontiac is also a poet, and wrote
'Hymns to the Gods' in <i>Blackwood</i>; but he has left Jupiter,
Juno, and the rest, and betaken himself to the culture of the Great
Spirit, or rather of two great spirits, whisky being the
second."</p>

<p>Van Dorn did not make his detailed official report of this
battle until the news had leaked out that the Indians had mangled
the bodies of the dead and committed other atrocities. He was
probably then desirous of being as silent as he dared be concerning
Indian participation, since he, in virtue of his being chief in
command, was the person mainly responsible for it. In October of
the preceding year, McCulloch had favored using the Indians against
Kansas [<i>Official Records</i>, vol. iii, 719, 721]. Cooper
objected strongly to their being kept "at home" [<i>ibid</i>., 614]

eighth, Colonel Watie's men under orders from Van Dorn took
position on the high ridges where they could watch the movements of
the enemy and give timely notice of any attempt to turn the
Confederate left flank. Colonel Drew's regiment, meanwhile, not
having received the word passed along the line to move forward,
remained in the woods near Leetown, the last in the field.
Subsequently, finding themselves deserted, they drew back towards
Camp Stephens, where they were soon joined by "General Cooper, with
his regiment and battalion of Choctaws and Chickasaws, and" by
"Colonel McIntosh with 200 men of his regiment of Creeks."<a id=

<p>The atrocities committed by the Indians became almost
immediately a matter for correspondence between the opposing
commanders. The Federals charged mutilation of dead bodies on the
battle-field and the tomahawking and scalping of prisoners. The
Confederates recriminated as against persons "alleged to be
Germans." The case involving the Indians was reported to the joint
committee of Congress on the <i>Conduct of the Present
War</i>;<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a><a href=

was not, at that time, forthcoming, a piece that, in a certain
sense, might be taken to exonerate the whites. It came to the
knowledge of General Blunt during the summer and was the Indians'
own confession. It bore only indirectly upon the actual atrocities
but showed that the red men were quite equal to making their own
plans in fighting and were not to be relied upon to do things
decently and in order. Drew's men, when they deserted the
Confederates after the skirmish of July third at Locust Grove,
confided to the Federals the intelligence "that the killing of the

northern part of Arkansas; but Van Dorn was very confident they
would not be able to subsist there long or "do much harm in the
west." In his opinion, therefore, it was incumbent upon the
Confederates, instead of dividing their strength between the east
and the west, to concentrate on the saving of the
Mississippi.<a id="footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a><a href=

Arkansas and Texas to rally to your aid. You may reward your Indian
troops by giving them such stores as you may think proper when they
make captures from the enemy, but you will please endeavor to
restrain them from committing any barbarities upon the wounded,
prisoners, or dead who may fall into their hands. You may purchase

<p>It was an elaborate programme but scarcely a noble one. Its note
of selfishness sounded high. The Indians were simply to be made to
serve the ends of the white men. Their methods of warfare were
regarded as distinctly inferior. Pea Ridge was, in fact, the first
and last time that they were allowed to participate in the war on a
big scale. Henceforth, they were rarely ever anything more than
scouts and skirmishers and that was all they were really fitted to
be.</p>

<h2>II. LANE'S BRIGADE AND THE INCEPTION OF THE INDIAN</h2>
<p>The Indian Expedition had its beginnings, fatefully or
otherwise, in "Lane's Kansas Brigade." On January 29, 1861,
President Buchanan signed the bill for the admission of Kansas into
the Union and the matter about which there had been so much of
bitter controversy was at last professedly settled; but, alas, for
the peace of the border, the radicals, the extremists, the
fanatics, call them what one may, who had been responsible for the
controversy and for its bitterness, were still unsettled. James
Lane was chief among them. His was a turbulent spirit and it
permitted its owner no cessation from strife. With President
Lincoln's first call for volunteers, April 15, 1861, Lane's martial
activities began. Within three days, he had gathered together a
company of warriors,<a id="footnotetag83" name=
"footnotetag83"></a><a href="#footnote83"><sup>83</sup></a> the
nucleus, psychologically speaking, of what was to be his notorious,
jayhawking, marauding brigade. His enthusiasm was infectious. It
communicated itself to reflective men like Carl Schurz<a id=
"footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a><a href=

Lane's</p>

Pomeroy and old Anthony Bleecker stood shoulder to shoulder in the

to privates or not."&mdash;THAYER, <i>Life and Letters of John

very much more magnanimous Lincoln, who, in the first days of the
war, as in the later and the last, had his hours of discouragement
and deep depression. For dejection of any sort, the wild excitement
and boundless confidence of a zealot like Lane must have been
somewhat of an antidote, also a stimulant.</p>

set itself at once to work to put the new machinery of government

his soul with gall by steady telescopic contemplation of a
Secession flag impudently flaunting over a roof in Alexandria. 'Let
me tell you,' said he to the elegant Teuton, 'we have got to whip
these scoundrels like hell, C. Schurz. They did a good thing

<p>the extra one, called for July, 1861. Immediately, a difficulty
arose due to the fact that, subsequent to his election to the
senatorship and in addition thereto, Lane had accepted a colonelcy
tendered by Oliver P. Morton<a id="footnotetag87" name=
"footnotetag87"></a><a href="#footnote87"><sup>87</sup></a> of
Indiana, his own native state.<a id="footnotetag88" name=
"footnotetag88"></a><a href="#footnote88"><sup>88</sup></a> Lane's
friends very plausibly contended that a military commission from
one state could not invalidate the title to represent another state
in the Federal senate. The actual fight over the contested seat
came in the next session and, quite regardless of consequences
likely to prejudice his case, Lane went on recruiting for his
brigade. Indeed, he commended himself to Fr&eacute;mont, who, in
his capacity as major-general of volunteers and in charge of the
Western Military District, assigned him to duty in Kansas, thus
greatly complicating an already delicate situation and immeasurably
heaping up difficulties, embarrassments, and disasters for the
frontier.</p>
<p>The same indifference towards the West that characterized the
governing authorities in the South was exhibited by eastern men in
the North and, correspondingly, the West, Federal and Confederate,
was unduly sensitive to the indifference, perhaps, also, a trifle
unnecessarily alarmed by symptoms of its own danger. Nevertheless,
its danger was real. Each state gave in its adherence to the
Confederacy separately and, therefore, every single state in the
slavery belt had a problem to solve. The fight for Missouri was
fought</p>

interest in the struggle for Kansas and in the events leading up to
the organization of the Republican party, was one of the most

<p>on the border and nowhere else. The great evil of squatter
sovereignty days was now epidemic in its most malignant form. Those
days had bred intense hatred between Missourian and Kansan and had
developed a disregard of the value of human life and a ruthlessness
and brutality in fighting, concomitant with it, that the East, in
its most primitive times, had never been called upon to experience.
Granted that the spirit of the crusader had inspired many a
free-soiler to venture into the trans-Missouri region after the
Kansas-Nebraska bill had become law and that real exaltation of
soul had transformed some very mercenary and altogether mundane
characters unexpectedly into martyrs; granted, also, that the
pro-slavery man honestly felt that his cause was just and that his
sacred rights of property, under the constitution, were being
violated, his preserves encroached upon, it yet remains true that
great crimes were committed in the name of great causes and that
villains stalked where only saints should have trod. The irregular
warfare of the border, from fifty-four on, while it may, to
military history as a whole, be as unimportant as the quarrels of
kites and crows, was yet a big part of the life of the frontiersman
and frightful in its possibilities. Sherman's march to the sea or
through the Carolinas, disgraceful to modern civilization as each
undeniably was, lacked the sickening phase, guerrilla atrocities,
that made the Civil War in the West, to those at least who were in
line to experience it at close range, an awful nightmare. Union and
Confederate soldiers might well fraternize in eastern camps because
there they so rarely had any cause for personal hostility towards
each other, but not in western. The fight on the border was
constant and to the death.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg
45]</span>
<p>The leaders in the West or many of them, on both sides, were men
of ungovernable tempers, of violent and unrestrained passions,
sometimes of distressingly base proclivities, although, in the
matter of both vices and virtues, there was considerable difference
of degree among them. Lane and Shelby and Montgomery and Quantrill
were hardly types, rather should it be said they were extreme
cases. They seem never to have taken chances on each other's
inactivity. Their motto invariably was, to be prepared for the
worst, and their practice, retaliation.</p>
<p>It was scarcely to be supposed that a man like Lane, who had
never known moderation in the course of the long struggle for
Kansas or been over scrupulous about anything would, in the event
of his adopted state's being exposed anew to her old enemy, the
Missourian, be able to pose contentedly as a legislator or stay
quietly in Washington, his role of guardian of the White House
being finished.<a id="footnotetag89" name=
"footnotetag89"></a><a href="#footnote89"><sup>89</sup></a> The
anticipated danger to Kansas visibly threatened in the summer of
1861 and the critical moment saw Lane again in the West, energetic
beyond precedent. He took up his position at Fort Scott, it being
his conviction that, from that point and from the line of the
Little Osage, the entire eastern section of the state, inclusive of
Fort Leavenworth, could best be protected.<a id="footnotetag90"

<p>As Villard tells us [<i>Memoirs</i>, vol. i, 169], Lane was in
command of the "Frontier Guards," one of the two special patrols
that protected the White House in the early days of the war. There
were those, however, who resented his presence there. For example,
note the diary entry of Hay, "Going to my room, I met the Captain.
He was a little boozy and very eloquent. He dilated on the troubles
of the time and bewailed the existence of a garrison in the White
House 'to give <i>&eacute;clat</i> to Jim Lane.'"&mdash;Thayer, op.
cit., vol. i, 94. The White House guard was in reality under
General Hunter [<i>Report of the Military Services of General David

the one, private in character, from Augustus Wattles, the other,
without specific date, from William Brooks:</p>
<p>PRIVATE</p>
<p>MONEKA, KANSAS, May 20, 1861.<br />
MR. DOLE</p>
<p>Dear Sir, A messenger has this moment left me, who came up from
the Osages yesterday&mdash;a distance of about forty miles. The
gentleman lives on the line joining the Osage Indians, and has,
since my acquaintance with him about three years.</p>
<p>A short time ago, perhaps three weeks, a number of lawless white
men went into the Nation and stole a number of ponies. The Indians
made chase, had a fight and killed several, reported from three to
five, and retook their ponies.</p>
<p>A company of men is now getting up here and in other counties,
to go and fight the Indians. I am appealed to by the Indians to act
as their friend.</p>
<p>They represent that they are loyal to the U.S. Government and
will fight for their Great Father, at Washington, but must be
protected from bad white men at home. The Government must not think
them enemies when they only fight thieves and robbers.</p>
<p>Rob't B. Mitchell, who was recently appointed Maj. General of
this State by Gov. Robinson, has resigned, and is now raising
volunteers to fight the Indians. He has always been a Democrat in
sympathy with the pro-slavery party, and his enlisting men now to
take them away from the Missouri frontier, when we are daily
threatened with an attack from that State, and union men are
fleeing to us for protection from there, is certainly a very
questionable policy. It could operate no worse against us, if it
were gotten up by a traitor to draw our men off on purpose to give
the Missourians a chance when we are unprepared. (cont.)</p>

Division of the U.S. Army would stop further proceedings.</p>
<p>I shall start to-morrow for Council Grove and meet the Kansas
Indians before General Mitchell's force can get there. As the point
of attack is secret, I fear it may be the Osages, for the purpose
of creating a necessity for a treaty with himself by which he can
secure a large quantity of land for himself and followers. He is
acquainted with all the old Democratic schemes of swindling
Indians.</p>
<p>The necessity for prompt action on the part of the Indian
Department increases every day. The element of discord in the
community here now, was once, the pro-slavery party. I see their
intention to breed disturbances with the Indians is malicious and
selfish. They are active and unscrupulous, and must be met promptly
and decisively.</p>

that have been and are now being made in Southern Kansas to arouse
both the "Osages" and "Cherokees" <i>to rebel</i>, and bear arms
against the U.S. Government&mdash;At a public meeting near the
South E. corner of the "Osage Nation" called by the settlements for
the devising of some means by which to protect themselves from
"unlawful characters," Mr. John Mathis, who resides in the Osage
Nation and has an Osage family, also Mr. "Robert Foster" who lives
in the Cherokee Nation and has a Cherokee family endeavered by
public speeches and otherwise to induce "Osages", "Cherokees", as
well as Americans who live on the "Neutral Lands" to bear arms
against the U.S. Government&mdash;<i>aledging that there was no
U.S. Government</i>. There was 25 men who joined them and they
proceeded to organise a "<i>Secession Company</i>" electing as Capt
R.D. Foster and 1st Lieutenant James Patton&mdash;This meeting was
held June 4th 1861&mdash;at "McGhees Residence"&mdash;The peace of
this section of country requires the removal of these men from the
Indian country, or some measures that will restrain them from
exciting the Indians in Southern Kansas.</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully WM BROOKS.</p>
<p>You will understand why you are addressed by a private
individual on this subject instead of the Agent, since A.J. Dorn,
the present Indian Agent, is an avowed "Secessionist" and
consequently would favor, rather than suppress the move. WM

<p>them their most natural inclination was to pay back old scores
and to make an alliance where such alliance could be most
profitable to themselves. The "remnants" of tribes, Senecas,
Shawnees, and Quapaws, associated with them in the agency, Neosho,
that is, although not of evil disposition, were similarly agitated
and with good reason. Rumors of dissensions among the Cherokees,
not so very far away, were naturally having a disquieting effect

the unrest in Missouri, in the southwestern counties of which,

<p>The Battle of Wilson's Creek, lost to the Federals largely

which the battle caused, was of itself a severe blow to the Union
side as represented in Missouri; but the moral effect of the
Federal defeat upon the Indians was equally worthy of note. It was
instantaneous and striking. It rallied the wavering Cherokees for
the Confederacy<a id="footnotetag99" name=

their defection was something that could not be easily
counterbalanced and was certainly not counterbalanced by the almost

Dole, August 14, 1861, gives some slight indication of its
insecurity:</p>
<p>OFFICE OF NEOSHO AGENCY<br />
Fort Scott, July 27, 1861.</p>
<p>Sir&mdash;I deem it important to inform the Department of the
situation of this Agency at this time. After entering upon the
duties of this office as per instructions&mdash;and attending to
all the business that seemed to require my immediate
attention&mdash;I repaired to Franklin Co. Kan. to remove my family
to the Agency.</p>
<p>Leaving the Agency in care of James Killebrew Esq the Gov't
Farmer for the Quapaw Nation. Soon after I left I was informed by
him that the Agency had been surrounded by a band of armed men, and
instituted an inquiry for "<i>that Abolition Superintendent and
Agent</i>." After various interrogatories and answers they returned
in the direction of Missouri and Arkansas lines from whence they
were supposed to have come. He has since written me and Special
Agent Whitney and Superintendent Coffin told me that it would be
very unsafe for me to stay at that place under the present excited
state of public feeling in that vicinity. I however started with my
family on the 6th July and arrived at Fort Scott on the 9th
intending to go direct to the Agency. Here I learned from Capt
Jennison commanding a detachment of Kansas Militia, who had been
scouting in that vicinity, that the country was full of marauding
parties from Gov. Jackson's Camp in S.W. Mo. I therefore concluded
to remain here and watch the course of events believing as I did

Springfield, which place he had left on the twenty-sixth of August,
would threaten, if he did not actually attempt, an invasion of
Kansas at the point of its greatest vulnerability, the extreme
southeast, hastened his preparations for the defence and at the
very end of the month appeared in person at Fort Scott, where all
the forces he could muster, many of them refugee Missourians, had
been rendezvousing. On the second of September, the two armies, if

<p>fallen in with the advance of the Confederates and, being
numerically outmatched, having been compelled to beat a retreat. In
its later stages, Lane personally conducted that retreat, which,
taken as a whole, did not end even with the recrossing of the state
boundary, although the pursuit did not continue beyond it.
Confident that Price would follow up his victory and attack Fort
Scott, Lane resolved to abandon the place, leaving a detachment to
collect the stores and ammunition and to follow him later. He then
hurried on himself to Fort Lincoln on the north bank of the Little
Osage, fourteen miles northwest. There he halted and hastily
erected breastworks of a certain sort<a id="footnotetag105" name=

Scott not the target.</p>

the people of Union sentiments inhabiting the Cherokee Neutral
Lands, where, indeed, intense excitement continued to prevail until
there was no longer any room to doubt that Price was really gone
from the near vicinity and was heading for the Missouri River. Yet
his departure was far from meaning the complete removal of all
cause for anxiety, since marauding bands infested the country
roundabout and were constantly setting forth, from some well
concealed lair, on expeditions of robbery, devastation, and murder.
It was one of those marauding bands that in this same month of
September, 1861, sacked and in part burnt Humboldt, for which
dastardly and quite unwarrantable deed, James G. Blunt, acting
under orders from Lane, took speedy vengeance; and the world was

<p>FT. LINCOLN, SOUTHERN KANSAS.<br />
Sept. 25, 1861.</p>
<p>HON. WM.P. DOLE, Com. of Ind. Af'rs</p>
<p>Dear Sir, We have just returned from a successful expedition
into the Indian Country, And I thought you would be glad to hear
the news.</p>
<p>Probably you know that Mathews, formerly an Indian Trader
amongst the Osages has been committing depredations at the head of
a band of half breed Cherokees, all summer.</p>
<p>He has killed a number of settlers and taken their property; but
as most of them were on the Cherokee neuteral lands I could not
tell whether to blame him much or not, as I did not understand the
condition of those lands.</p>
<p>A few days ago he came up to Humbolt and pillaged the town. Gen.
Lane ordered the home guards, composed mostly of old men, too old
for regular service, to go down and take or disperse this company
under Mathews.</p>
<p>He detailed Lieut. Col. Blunt of Montgomery's regiment to the
command, and we started about 200 strong. We went to Humbolt and
followed down through the Osage as far as the Quapaw Agency where
we came up with them, about 60 strong.</p>
<p>Mathews and 10 men were killed at the first fire, the others
(cont.)</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg
54]</span>
<p>As soon as Lane had definite knowledge that Price had turned
away from the border and was moving northward, he determined to
follow after and attack</p>
<blockquote class="footnote"><b>Footnote 109:</b> <a href=
"#footnotetag109">(return)</a>
<p>(cont.) retreated. We found on Mathews a Commission from Ben.
McCulloch, authorizing him to enlist the Quapaw and other Indians
and operate on the Kansas frontier.</p>
<p>The Osage Indians are loyal, and I think most of the others
would be if your Agents were always ready to speak a word of
confidence for our Government, and on hand to counteract the
influence of the Secession Agents.</p>
<p>There is no more danger in doing this than in any of the Army
service. If an Agent is killed in the discharge of his duty,
another can be appointed the same as in any other service. A few
prompt Agents, might save a vast amount of plundering which it is
now contemplated to do in Kansas.</p>
<p>Ben. McCulloch promises his rangers, and the Indians that he
will winter them in Kansas and expel the settlers.</p>
<p>I can see the Indians gain confidence in him precisely as they
loose it in us. It need somebody amongst them to represent our
power and strength and purposes, and to give them courage and
confidence in the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>There is another view which some take and you may take the same,
i.e. let them go&mdash;fight and conquer them&mdash;take their
lands and stop their annuities.</p>
<p>I can only say that whatever the Government determines on the
people here will sustain. The President was never more popular. He
is the President of the Constitution and the laws. And
notwithstanding what the papers say about his difference with
Fr&eacute;mont, every heart reposes confidence in the
President.</p>
<p>So far as I can learn from personal inquiry, the Indians are not
yet committed to active efforts against the Gov. AUG. WATTLES.</p>

an office tho near half a mile from town was burnt tho his dwelling
and mill near by were spared. All my books and papers that were
there were lost. My trunk and what little me and my son had left

acres and one 120. Our Minne Rifle and ammunition Saddle bridle,

<p>detachments instead of in force produced its own calamitous
result. There had never been any appreciable co&ouml;rdination
among the parts of Fr&eacute;mont's army. Each worked upon a
campaign of its own. To some extent, the same criticism might be
held applicable to the opposing Confederate force also, especially
when the friction between Price and McCulloch be taken fully into
account; but Price's energy was far in excess of Fr&eacute;mont's
and he, having once made a plan, invariably saw to its
accomplishment. Lincoln viewed Fr&eacute;mont's supineness with
increasing apprehension and finally after the fall of Lexington
directed Scott to instruct for greater activity. Presumably,
Fr&eacute;mont had already aroused himself somewhat; for, on the
eighteenth, he had ordered Lane to proceed to Kansas City and from
thence to co&ouml;perate with Sturgis,<a id="footnotetag115" name=

managed, while obeying, to do considerable marauding, which worked
greatly to the general detestation and lasting discredit of his
brigade. For a man, temperamentally constituted as Lane was,
warfare had no terrors and its votaries, no scruples. The grim
chieftain as he has been somewhat fantastically called, was cruel,
indomitable, and disgustingly licentious, a person who would have
hesitated at nothing to accomplish his purpose. It was to be
expected, then, that he would see nothing terrible in the letting
loose of the bad white man, the half-civilized Indian, or the
wholly barbarous negro upon society. He believed that the

<p>There was no doubt by this time that Lane had it in mind to
utilize the Indians. In the dog days of August, when he was
desperately marshaling his brigade, the Indians presented
themselves, in idea, as a likely military contingent. The various
Indian agents in Kansas were accordingly communicated with and
Special Agent Augustus Wattles authorized to make the needful
preparations for Indian enlistment.<a id="footnotetag122" name=

much could be done in furtherance of the scheme while Lane was

his interest again manifested itself. He was then recruiting among
all kinds of people, the more hot-blooded the better. His energy
was likened to frenzy and the more sober-minded took alarm. It was
the moment for his political opponents to interpose and Governor
Robinson from among them did interpose, being firmly convinced that
Lane, by his intemperate zeal and by his guerrilla-like fighting
was provoking Missouri to reprisals and thus precipitating upon
Kansas the very troubles that he professed to wish to ward off.
Incidentally, Robinson, unlike Fr&eacute;mont, was vehemently
opposed to Indian enlistment.</p>

<p>Lane's efforts towards securing Indian enlistment did not stop
with soliciting the Kansas tribes. Thoroughly aware, since the time
of his sojourn at Fort Scott, if not before, of the delicate
situation in Indian Territory, of the divided allegiance there, and
of the despairing cry for help that had gone forth from the Union
element to Washington, he conceived it eminently fitting and
practicable that that same Union element should have its loyalty
put to good uses and be itself induced to take up arms in behalf of
the cause it affected so ardently to endorse. To an ex-teacher
among the Seminoles, E.H. Carruth, was entrusted the task of
recruiting.</p>

<p>Secretary Cameron's reply to Secretary Smith's first request was
uncompromising in the extreme and prophetic of his persistent
refusal to recognize the obligation resting upon the United States
to protect its defenceless "wards." This is Cameron's letter of May
10, 1861:</p>

<p>Although his refusal to keep faith with the Indians is not

No student of history questions to-day that the appointment of
Simon Cameron to the portfolio of war, to which Thaddeus Stevens
had aspirations [Woodburn, <i>Life of Thaddeus Stevens</i>, 239],

<p>the poor neglected Indians had been driven to the last desperate
straits. The next month, October, nothing at all having been done
in the interval, Dole submitted<a id="footnotetag138" name=
"footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138"><sup>138</sup></a> to
Secretary Smith new evidence of a most alarmingly serious state of
affairs and asked that the president's attention be at once
elicited. The apparent result was that about the middle of
November, Dole was able to write with confidence&mdash;and he was
writing at the request of the president&mdash;that the United
States was prepared to maintain itself in its authority over the
Indians at all hazards.<a id="footnotetag139" name=

<p>Boastful words those were and not to be made good until many
precious months had elapsed and many sad regrettable scenes
enacted. In early November occurred the reorganization of the
Department of the West which meant the formation of a Department of
Kansas separate and distinct from a Department of Missouri, an
arrangement that afforded ample opportunity for a closer attention
to local exigencies in both states than had heretofore been
possible or than, upon trial, was subsequently to be deemed
altogether desirable. It necessarily increased the chances for
local patronage and exposed military matters to the grave danger of
becoming hopelessly entangled with political.</p>
<p>The need for change of some sort was, however, very evident and
the demand for it, insistent. If the southern Indians were not soon
secured, they were bound to menace, not only Kansas, but

<p>(a). LAWRENCE, KANSAS, Dec. 14th, 1861.</p>
<p>HON.W.P. DOLE, Commissioner of Ind. Affairs</p>
<p>Dear Sir, It is with reluctance that I again intrude on your
valuable time. But I am induced to do so by the conviction that the
subject of our Indian relations is really a matter of serious
concern: as involving the justice and honor of our own Government,
and the deepest interests&mdash;the very existence, indeed&mdash;of
a helpless and dependent people. And knowing that it is your wish
to be furnished with every item of information which may, in any
way, throw light on the subject, I venture to trouble you with
another letter.</p>
<p>Mico Hat-ki, the Creek man referred to in my letter of Oct. 31st
has been back to the Creek Nation, and returned about the middle of
last month. He was accompanied, to this place, by one of his former
companions, but had left some of their present company at LeRoy.
They were expecting to have a meeting with some of the Indians, at
LeRoy, to consult about the proper course to be pursued, in order
to protect the loyal and peaceable Indians, from the hostility of
the disaffected, who have become troublesome and menacing in their
bearing.</p>
<p>With this man and his companion, I had considerable
conversation, and find that the Secessionists and disaffected
Half-breeds are carrying things with a high hand. While the loyal
Indians are not in a condition to resist them, by reason of the
proximity of an overwhelming rebel force.</p>
<p>From them (repeating their former statements, regarding the
defection of certain parties, and the loyalty of others, with the
addition of some further particulars) I learn the following facts:
Viz. That M Kennard, the Principal Chief of the Lower Creeks, most
of the McIntoshes, George Stidham, and others have joined the
rebels, and organized a military force in their interest; for the
purpose of intimidating and harrassing the loyal Indians. They name
some of the officers, but are not sufficiently conversant with
military terms to distinguish the different grades, with much
exactness. Unee McIntosh, however, is the highest in rank, (a
Colonel I presume) and Sam Cho-co-ti, George Stidham, Chilly
McIntosh, are all officers in the Lower Creek rebel force.</p>
<p>Among the Upper Creeks, John Smith, Timiny Barnet and Wm.
Robinson, are leaders.</p>
<p>Among the Seminoles, John Jumper, the Principal Chief, is on the
side of the rebels. Pas-co-fa, the second chief, stands neutral.

<p>(cont.) among the Seminoles in favor of the rebellion. They say
the full Indians will kill him.</p>
<p>The Choctaws are divided in much the same way as the other
Tribes, the disaffected being principally among the
Half-breeds.</p>
<p>The Chickasaw Governor, Harris, is a Secessionist; and so are
most, if not all, the Colberts. The full Indians are loyal to the
Government, as are some of the mixed bloods also, and here, I
remark, from my own knowledge, that this Governor Harris was the
first to propose the adoption of concerted measures, among the
Southern Tribes, on the subject of Secession. This was instantly
and earnestly opposed by John Ross, as being out of place, and an
ungrateful violation of the Treaty obligations, by which the Tribes
had placed themselves under the exclusive protection of the United
States; and, under which, they had enjoyed a long course of peace
and prosperity.</p>
<p>They say, there are about four hundred Secessionists, among the
Cherokees. But whether organized or not, I did not understand. I
presume they meant such as were formerly designated by the term
Warriors, somewhat analogous to the class among ourselves, who are
fit for military duty, though they may or may not be actually
organized and under arms. So that the <i>Thousands of Indians</i>
in the secession papers, as figuring in the armies, are enormous
exaggerations; and most of them sheer fabrications.</p>
<p>Albert Pike, of Little Rock, boasts of having visited and made
treaty alliances with the Comanches, and other tribes, on behalf of
the "Confederate States," but the Indians do not believe him. And,
in blunt style, say "he tells lies."</p>
<p>They make favorable mention of O-poth-le-yo-ho-lo, an ex-Creek
Chief, a true patriot of former days. But, it seems, he has been
molested and forced to leave his home to avoid the annoyance and
violence of the rebel party. There are, however, more than three
thousand young men, of the warrior class, who adhere to his
principles, and hold true faith and allegiance to the United
States.</p>
<p>They say also that John Ross is not a Secessionist, and that
there are more than four thousand patriots among the Cherokees, who
are true to the Government of the United States. This agrees,
substantially, with my own personal knowledge, unless they have
changed within a very short time, which is not at all probable, as
the Cherokees, of this class, are pretty fully and correctly
informed about the nature of the controversy. And I may add, that
much of their information is, through one channel and another,
communicated to the Creeks, and much of their spirit too.</p>
<p>On the whole, judging from the most reliable information, I have
been able to obtain, I feel assured that the Full Indians of the
Creeks, Cherokees, Seminoles, and the small bands living in the
Creek Nation, are faithful to the Government. And the same, to a
great extent, is (cont.)</p>

the proximity of the rebel force, the loyal Indians would put down
the Secession movement among themselves, at once. Or rather, they
would not have suffered it to rise at all.</p>
<p>The loyal Indians say, they wish "to stand by their Old
Treaties." And they are as persistent in their adherence to these
Treaties, as we are, to our Constitution. And I have no doubt that,
as soon as the Government can afford them protection, they will be
ready, at the first call, to manifest, by overt action, the loyalty
to which they are pledged.</p>
<p>They are looking, with great anxiety and hope, for the coming of
the great army. And I have no doubt that a friendly communication
from the Government, through the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
would have a powerful effect in removing any false impressions,
which may have been made, on the ignorant and unwary, by the
emissaries of Secession, and to encourage and reassure the loyal
friends of the Government, who, in despair of timely aid, may have
been compelled to yield any degree of submission, to the pressure
of an overwhelming force. I was expecting to see these Indians
again, and to have had further conversation with them. But I am
informed by Charles Johnnycake that they have gone to Fort
Leavenworth and expect to go on to Washington. Hearing this, I
hesitated about troubling you with this letter at all, as, in that
case, you would see them yourself. But I have concluded to send it,
as affording me an opportunity to express a few thoughts, with
which it would hardly be worth while to occupy a separate
letter.</p>
<p>Hoping that the counsels and movements of the Government may be
directed by wisdom from above, and that the cause of truth and
right may prevail, I remain with great respect, Dear Sir, Your
Obedient Ser'v EVAN JONES.</p>
<p>P.S. I rec. a note from Mr. Carruth, saying that he was going to
Washington, with a delegation of Southern Indians, and I suppose
Mico Hatki and his companions are that Delegation, or at least a
part of them.</p>
<p>I will just say in regard to Mr. Carruth that I was acquainted
with him, several years ago, as a teacher in the Cherokee Nation.
He afterwards went to the Creek Nation, I <i>think</i>, as teacher
of a Government school, and I believe, has been there ever since.
If so, he must know a good deal about the Creeks. Mr. Carruth bore
a good character. I think he married one of the Missionary ladies
of the Presbyterian Mission.</p>

<p>Upon assuming command of the Department of Kansas, General
Hunter took full cognizance of the many things making for
disquietude and turmoil in the country now under his jurisdiction.
Indian relations became, of necessity, matters of prime concern.
Three things bear witness to this fact, Hunter's plans for an
inter-tribal council at Fort Leavenworth, his own headquarters; his
advocacy of Indian enlistment, especially from among the southern
Indians; and his intention, early avowed, of bringing
Brigadier-general James W. Denver into military prominence and of
entrusting to him the supervisory command in Kansas. In some
respects, no man could have been found equal to Denver in
conspicuous fitness for such a position. He had served as
commissioner of Indian affairs<a id="footnotetag147" name=

under Buchanan and, although a Virginian by birth, had had a large
experience with frontier life&mdash;in Missouri, in the Southwest
during the Mexican War, and in California. He had also measured
swords with Lane. It was in squatter-sovereignty days when, first
as secretary and then as governor of Kansas Territory, he had been
in a position to become intimately acquainted with the intricacies
of Lane's true character and had had both occasion and opportunity
to oppose some of that worthy's autocratic and thoroughly
lawless</p>

to give him. With the second summons to command, came opportunity
for Lane's vindictive animosity to be called into play.
Historically, it furnished conclusive proof, if any were needed,
that Lane had supreme power over the distribution of Federal
patronage in his own state and exercised that power even at the
cost of the well-being and credit of his constituency.</p>
<p>When Congress began its second session in December, the fight
against Lane for possession of his seat in the Senate proceeded
apace; but that did not, in the least, deter him from working for
his brigade. His scheme now was to have it organized on a different
footing from that which it had sustained heretofore. His influence
with the administration in Washington was still very peculiar and
very considerable, so much so, in fact, that President Lincoln,
without taking expert advice and without consulting either the
military men, whose authority would necessarily be affected, or the
civil officials in Kansas, nominated him to the Senate as
brigadier-general to have charge of troops in that state.<a id=

<p>The Leavenworth <i>Daily Conservative</i> seemed fairly jubilant
over the prospect of Lane's early return to military activity. The
following extracts from its news items and editorials convey some
such idea:</p>
<p>"General Lane of Kansas has been nominated to the Senate and
unanimously confirmed, as Brigadier General, to command Kansas
troops; the express understanding being that General Lane's seat in
the Senate shall not be vacated until he accepts his new
commission, which he will not do until the Legislature of Kansas
assembles, next month. He has no idea of doing anything that shall

<p>at the time this was done and apparently, when apprised of it,
made some objections on the score, not so much of an invasion of
his own prerogative, as of its probable effect upon Hunter. Cameron
had his first consultation with Lane regarding the matter, January
second, and was given by him to understand that everything had been
done in strict accordance with Hunter's own wishes.<a id=
"footnotetag152" name="footnotetag152"></a><a href=
"#footnote152"><sup>152</sup></a> The practical question of the
relation of Lane's brigade to Hunter's command soon, however,
presented itself in a somewhat different light and its answer
required a more explicit statement from the president than had yet
been made. Lincoln, when appealed to, unhesitatingly repudiated
every suggestion of the idea that it had ever been his intention to
give Lane an independent command or to have Hunter, in any sense,
superseded.<a id="footnotetag153" name=

<p>The need for sending relief to the southern Indians, which,
correctly interpreted meant, of course, reasserting authority over
them and thus removing a menacing and impending danger from the
Kansas border, had been one of Lane's strongest arguments in
gaining his way with the administration. The larger aspect of his
purpose was, however, the one that appealed to Commissioner Dole,
who, as head of the Indian Bureau, seems fully to have appreciated

<p>Representations of the great need of the Indians for assistance
were made to the government by all sorts of people. Agent after

repeatedly and on the second of January had sent information,
brought to him at Lawrence by two fugitive Cherokees, of the recent
battle in which the loyalists under Opoethle-yo-ho-la had been
worsted, at the Big Bend of the Arkansas [Indian Office Special
Files, no. 201, <i>Southern Superintendency</i>, J 540 of 1862]. In
the early winter, a mixed delegation of Creeks and others had made
their way to Washington, hoping by personal entreaty to obtain
succor for their distressed people, and justice. Hunter had issued
a draft for their individual relief [<i>ibid</i>., J523 of 1861],
and passes from Fort Leavenworth to Washington [<i>ibid</i>., C1433

HON WM.P. DOLE, Com. Indian Affs.</p>
<p>Sir: On my arrival in St. Louis I found Gen'l Hunter at the
Planters House and delivered the message to him that you had placed
in my hands for that purpose. He seemed fully satisfied with your
letter and has acted on it accordingly. I recd from Gen'l Hunter a
letter for Mr. Cutler, and others of this place, all of which I
have delivered. Having found Cutler here, he having been ordered by
Lane to move the council from Leroy to Fort Scott. But from some
cause (which I have not learned) he has brought the chiefs all here
to the Fort, where they are now quartered awaiting the arrival of
Gen'l Hunter. He has with him six of the head chiefs of the Creek,
Seminole and Cherokee Nations, and tells me that they are strong
for the Union. He also says that John Ross (Cherokee) is all right
but dare not let it be known, and that he will be here if he can
get away from the tribe.</p>
<p>These chiefs all say they want to fight for the Union, and that
they will do so if they can get arms and ammunition. Gen'l Hunter
has ordered me to await his arrival here at which time he will
council with these men, and report to you the result. I think he
will be here on Tuesday or Wednesday. Cutler wants to take the
Indians to Washington, but I advised him not to do so until I could
hear from you. When I met him here he was on his way there.</p>
<p>You had better write to him here as soon as you get this, or you
will see him there pretty soon.</p>

two.</p>

their natural instincts would be given free play. Conceivably then,

<h2>III. THE INDIAN REFUGEES IN SOUTHERN KANSAS</h2>
<p>The thing that would most have justified the military employment
of Indians by the United States government, in the winter of 1862,
was the fact that hundreds and thousands of their southern brethren
were then refugees because of their courageous and unswerving
devotion to the American Union. The tale of those refugees, of
their wanderings, their deprivations, their sufferings, and their
wrongs, comparable only to that of the Belgians in the Great
European War of 1914, is one of the saddest to relate, and one of
the most disgraceful, in the history of the War of Secession, in
its border phase.</p>
<p>The first in the long procession of refugees were those of the
army of Opoeth-le-yo-ho-la who, after their final defeat by Colonel
James McIntosh in the Battle of Chustenahlah, December 26, 1861,
had fled up the valley of the Verdigris River and had entered
Kansas near Walnut Creek. In scattered lines, with hosts of
stragglers, the enfeebled, the aged, the weary, and the sick, they
had crossed the Cherokee Strip and the Osage Reservation and,
heading steadily towards the northeast, had finally encamped on the
outermost edge of the New York Indian Lands, on Fall River, some
sixty odd miles west of Humboldt. Those lands, never having been
accepted as an equivalent for their Wisconsin holdings by the
Iroquois, were not occupied throughout their entire extent by
Indians and only here and there</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg
80]</span>
<p>encroached upon by white intruders, consequently the
impoverished and greatly fatigued travellers encountered no
obstacles in settling themselves down to rest and to wait for a
much needed replenishment of their resources.</p>
<p>Their coming was expected. On their way northward, they had
fallen in, at some stage of the journey, with some buffalo hunters,
Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi, returning to their reservation,
which lay some distance north of Burlington and chiefly in present
Osage County, Kansas. To them the refugees reported their recent
tragic experience. The Sacs and Foxes were most sympathetic and,
after relieving the necessities of the refugees as best they could,
hurried on ahead, imparting the news, in their turn, to various
white people whom they met. In due course it reached General
Denver, still supervising affairs in Kansas, and William G. Coffin,
the southern superintendent.<a id="footnotetag165" name=
"footnotetag165"></a><a href="#footnote165"><sup>165</sup></a> It
was the first time, since his appointment the spring before, that
Coffin had had any prospect of getting in touch with any

chance of now really earning his salary. He ordered all of the
agents under him&mdash;and some<a id="footnotetag166" name=

<p>several contingents; for the refugees, although chiefly Creeks,
were representative of nearly every one of the non-indigenous
tribes of Indian Territory.</p>
<p>It is not an easy matter to say, with any show of approach to
exact figures, how many the refugees numbered.<a id=
"footnotetag167" name="footnotetag167"></a><a href=
"#footnote167"><sup>167</sup></a> For weeks and weeks, they were
almost continually coming in and even the very first reports bear
suspicious signs of the exaggeration that became really notorious
as graft and peculation entered more and more into the reckoning.
Apparently, all those who, in ever so slight a degree, handled the
relief funds, except, perhaps, the army men, were interested in
making the numbers appear as large as possible. The larger the need
represented, the larger the sum that might, with propriety, be
demanded and the larger the opportunity for graft. Settlers,
traders, and some government agents were, in this respect, all
culpable together.</p>
<p>There was no possibility of mistake, however, intentional or
otherwise, about the destitution of the refugees. It was
inconceivably horrible. The winter weather of late December and
early January had been most inclement and the Indians had trudged
through it, over snow-covered, rocky, trailless places and desolate
prairie, nigh three hundred miles. When they started out, they were
not any too well provided with clothing; for they had departed in a
hurry, and, before they got to Fall River, not a few of them were
absolutely naked. They had practically no tents, no bed-coverings,
and no provisions. Dr. A.B. Campbell, a surgeon sent out by General
Hunter,<a id="footnotetag168" name="footnotetag168"></a><a href=

so wretched that it was impossible for him to depict it. Prairie
grasses were "their only protection from the snow" upon which they
were lying "and from the wind and weather scraps and rags stretched
upon switches." Ho-go-bo-foh-yah, the second Creek chief, was ill
with a fever and "his tent (to give it that name) was no larger
than a small blanket stretched over a switch ridge pole, two feet
from the ground, and did not reach it by a foot from the ground on
either side of him." Campbell further said that the refugees were
greatly in need of medical assistance. They were suffering "with
inflammatory diseases of the chest, throat, and eyes." Many had
"their toes frozen off," others, "their feet wounded." But few had
"either shoes or moccasins." Dead horses were lying around in every
direction and the sanitary conditions were so bad that the food was
contaminated and the newly-arriving refugees became sick as soon as
they ate.<a id="footnotetag169" name="footnotetag169"></a><a href=

inefficiency of the Federal never showed up more plainly, to the
utter discredit of the nation, than at this period and in this
connection.</p>
<p>Besides getting permission from Secretary Smith to go ahead and
supply the more pressing needs of the refugees, Dole accomplished
another thing greatly to their interest. He secured from the staff
of General Lane a special agent, Dr. William Kile of
Illinois,<a id="footnotetag175" name="footnotetag175"></a><a href=

he at once visited their encampment in order the better to
determine their requirements. His investigations more than
corroborated the earlier accounts of their sufferings and
privations and his appointment under the circumstances seemed fully
justified, notwithstanding that on the surface of things it
appeared very suggestive of a near approach to nepotism, and of
nepotism Dole, Coffin, and many others were unquestionably guilty.
They worked into the service just as many of their own relatives
and friends as they conveniently and safely could. The official
pickings were considered by them as their proper perquisites.

desirable location for the refugees. Only a very few white people
were settled there and, as they were intruders and had not a shadow

therefore, in the disgruntled state of the refugees, which was due,

the Osages, Coffin heard of "a sneaking conspiracy" that was "on
foot at Iola for the purpose of prejudicing the Indians against us
[himself and Dole, perhaps, or possibly himself and the agents]."
The plotters, so Coffin reported, "sent over the Verdigris for E.H.
Carruth who" was "deep in the plot," which was a scheme to induce
the Indians to lodge complaint against the distributers of relief.
One of the conspirators was a man who had studied law under Lane
and who had wanted a position under Kile. Lane had used his
influence in the man's behalf and the refusal of Coffin to assign
him to a position was supposed to be the cause of all the trouble.
Coffin learned that his enemies had even gone so far as to plan
vacancies in the Indian service and to fill them. They had
"instructed Lane, Pomeroy, and Conway accordingly," leaving
graciously to Lane the choice of superintendent. A Mr. Smith,
correspondent of the Cincinnati <i>Gazette</i> was their accredited

<h2>IV. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FIRST INDIAN EXPEDITION</h2>
<p>Among the manifold requests put forward by the refugees, none
was so insistent, none so dolefully sincere, as the one for means
to return home. It is a mistake to suppose that the Indian,
traditionally laconic and stoical, is without family affection and
without that noblest of human sentiments, love of country. The
United States government has, indeed, proceeded upon the
supposition that he is destitute of emotions, natural to his more
highly civilized white brother, but its files are full to
overflowing with evidences to the contrary. Everywhere among them
the investigator finds the exile's lament. The red man has been
banished so often from familiar and greatly loved scenes that it is
a wonder he has taken root anywhere and yet he has. Attachment to
the places where the bones of his people lie is with him the most
constant of experiences and his cry for those same sacred places is
all the stronger and the more sorrowful because it has been
persistently ignored by the white man.</p>
<p>The southern Indians had not been so very many years in the
Indian Territory, most of them not more than the span of one
generation, but Indian Territory was none the less home. If the
refugees could only get there again, they were confident all would
be well with them. In Kansas, they were hungry, afflicted with
disease, and dying daily by the score.<a id="footnotetag193" name=

<p>all the ills of the flesh would disappear and lost friends be
recovered. The exodus had separated them cruelly from each other.
There were family and tribal encampments within the one large
encampment,<a id="footnotetag194" name=
"footnotetag194"></a><a href="#footnote194"><sup>194</sup></a> it
is true, but there were also widely isolated groups, scattered
indiscriminately across two hundred miles of bleak and lonely
prairie, and no amount of philanthropic effort on the part of the
government agents could mitigate the misery arising therefrom or
bring the groups together. The task had been early abandoned as,
under the circumstances, next to impossible; but the refugees went
on begging for its accomplishment, notwithstanding that they had
neither the physical strength nor the means to render any
assistance themselves. Among them the wail of the bereaved vied in
tragic cadence with the sad inquiry for the missing.</p>
<p>When Dole arrived at Leavenworth the latter part of January,
representatives of the loyal Indians interviewed him and received
assurances, honest and well-meant at the time given, that an early
return to Indian Territory would be made possible. Lane, likewise
interviewed,<a id="footnotetag195" name=

similarly encouraging and had every reason to be; for was not his
Indian brigade in process of formation? Much cheered and even
exhilarated in spirit, the Indians went away to endure and to wait.

of waiting. The waiting</p>

<p>seemed so hopeless to them miserable, so endlessly long.
Primitive as they were, they simply could not understand why the
agents of a great government could not move more expeditiously. The
political and military aspects of the undertaking, involved in
their return home, were unknown to them and, if known, would have
been uncomprehended. Then, too, the vacillation of the government
puzzled them. They became suspicious; for they had become
acquainted, through the experience of long years, with the white
man's bad faith and they had nothing to go upon that would
counteract the influence of earlier distrust. And so it happened,
that, as the weary days passed and Lane's brigade did not
materialize, every grievance that loomed up before them took the
shape of a disappointed longing for home.</p>
<p>So poignant was their grief at the continued delay that they
despaired of ever getting the help promised and began to consider
how they could contrive a return for themselves. And yet, quite
independent of Lane's brigade, there had been more than one
movement initiated in their behalf. The desire to recover lost
ground in Indian Territory, under the pretext of restoring the
fugitives, aroused the fighting instinct of many young men in
southern Kansas and several irregular expeditions were
projected.<a id="footnotetag196" name="footnotetag196"></a><a href=
"#footnote196"><sup>196</sup></a> Needless to say they came to
nothing. In point of fact, they never really developed, but died

free to operate, if it so willed, on the Indian Territory
border.</p>

<p>Closely following upon the Federal success of March 6 to 8, came
numerous changes and readjustments in the Missouri-Kansas commands;
but they were not so much the result of that success as they were a
part of the general reorganization that was taking place in the
Federal service incident to the more efficient war administration
of Secretary Stanton. By order of March 11, three military
departments were arranged for, the Department of the Potomac under
McClellan, that of the Mountain under Fr&eacute;mont, and that of
the Mississippi under Halleck. The consolidation of Hunter's
Department of Kansas with Halleck's Department of Missouri was thus
provided for and had long been a consummation devoutly to be
wished.<a id="footnotetag197" name="footnotetag197"></a><a href=
"#footnote197"><sup>197</sup></a> Both were naturally parts of the

Neither could be operated upon independently of the other.
Moreover, both were infested by political vultures. In both, the
army discipline was, in consequence, bad; that is, if it could be
said to be in existence at all. If anything, Kansas was in a worse
state than Missouri. Her condition, as far as the military forces
were concerned, had not much improved since Hunter first took
command and it was then about the worst that could possibly be
imagined. Major Halpine's description<a id="footnotetag198" name=

<p>Halleck's plans for remodeling the constituent elements of his
department were made with a thorough comprehension of the
difficulties confronting him. It is not surprising that they
brought General Denver again to the fore. Hunter's troubles had
been bred by local politics. That Halleck well knew; but he also
knew that Indian relations were a source of perplexity and that
there was no enemy actually in Kansas and no enemy worth

<p>Steele inferred from what passed at the interview with Halleck
that the commanding general was decidedly opposed to arming
Indians. Steele found him also non-committal as to when the
auxiliary force would be available.<a id="footnotetag227" name=
"footnotetag227"></a><a href="#footnote227"><sup>227</sup></a>
Dole's letter, with its seeming dictation as to the choice of a
commander for the expedition, may not have been to Halleck's
liking. He was himself at the moment most interested in the
suppression of guerrillas and jayhawkers, against whom sentence of
outlawry had just been passed. As it happened, that was the work in
which Dole's nominee, Colonel Robert B. Mitchell,<a id=

Halleck may have objected to his being thought of for other things.
Furthermore, Dole had no right to so much as cast a doubt upon
Halleck's own ability to select a proper commander.</p>
<p>A little perplexed but not at all daunted by Halleck's lack of
cordiality, Steele proceeded on his journey and, arriving at
Leavenworth, presented his credentials to Captain McNutt, who was
in charge of the arsenal. Four hundred Indian rifles were at hand,

<p>Quoted from the <i>Daily Conservative</i> of May 20; but not

the implication that all of Sturgis's measures were arbitrary and
wrong. Something strenuous was needed in Kansas. The arrest of
Jennison and of Hoyt [<i>ibid</i>., April 19, 23, 1862] because of

administration in Washington, peculiarly sensitive to political
importunities, not to retain, outside of Kansas, the Kansas troops
if he could possibly avoid it, there had been more or less of
rancor between him and them. His opinion of them was that they were

commanding the First Regiment Indian Home Guards, to Dole, May 4,

Kansas, and reads thus:</p>

Blunt should think necessary. They were to be supplied with
transportation and subsistence and Blunt was to "designate the

activity of secessionists, Indians and white men, in southwest
Missouri, which would, of itself, suggest the inquiry as to what
the Indian allies of the Confederacy had been about since the
Battle of Pea Ridge. Van Dorn had ordered them to retire towards
their own country and, while incidentally protecting it, afford
assistance to their white ally by harassing the enemy, cutting off
his supply trains, and annoying him generally. The order had been
rigidly attended to and the Indians had done their fair share of
the irregular warfare that terrorized and desolated the border in
the late spring of the second year of the war. Not all of them,
regularly enlisted, had participated in it, however; for General
Pike had, with a considerable part of his brigade, gone away from
the border as far as possible and had intrenched himself at a fort
of his own planning, Fort McCulloch, in the Choctaw Nation, on the

<p>SIR: I beg leave to thank you for your kind response to my
letter of the 22nd ulto and your order stationing Col. Drew's
Regiment in this vicinity. Though much reduced by furloughs in
number it will be useful for the particular purposes for which it
was ordered here. The unprotected condition of the country however
is a source of general anxiety among the People, who feel that they
are liable to be overrun at any time by small parties from the U.S.
Army which remains in the vicinity of the late Battle Ground. This
is more particularly the case since the removal of the Confederate
Forces under your command and those under Major Gen'l Price.
Without distrusting the wisdom that has prompted these movements,
or the manifestation of any desire on my part to enquire into their
policy it will be nevertheless a source of satisfaction to be able
to assure the people of the country that protection will not be
withheld from them and that they will not be left to their own
feeble defense. Your response is respectfully requested, I have the
honor to be Sir with high regards, Your Obt Servt. JOHN ROSS,

are in front of me, in their country, part on this side of Boggy
and part at Little Boggy, 34 miles from here. These observe the
roads to Fort Smith and by Perryville toward Fort Gibson. Part of
the Chickasaw battalion is sent to Camp McIntosh, 11 miles this
side of the Wichita Agency, and part to Fort Arbuckle, and the
Texan company is at Fort Cobb.</p>

march to and take Fort Larned, on the Pawnee Fork of the Arkansas,
where are considerable stores and a little garrison. He will go as
soon as their annuity is paid.</p>
<p>The Creeks under Colonel McIntosh are about to make an extended
scout westward. Stand Watie, with his Cherokees, scouts along the
whole northern line of the Cherokee country from Grand Saline to
Marysville, and sends me information continually of every movement
of the enemy in Kansas and Southwestern Missouri.</p>
<p>The Comanches, Kiowas, and Reserve Indians are all peaceable and
quiet. Some 2,000 of the former are encamped about three days' ride
from Fort Cobb, and some of them come in at intervals to procure
provisions. They have sent to me to know</p>

<p>Two Regiments of white troops and Rabb's Battery have already

Doubleday, who is in command, has notified the officers here to
prepare with all possible despatch, for marching orders. We are
looking for Aliens Battery here this week and if it comes I hope to
make considerable addition to the Army from the loyal Refugee
Indians here, as they have great confidence in "<i>them waggons
that shoot</i>," this has been a point with them all the time.</p>
<p>We were still feeding those that are mustered in and shall I
suppose have to do so until the requisitions arive. The Dellawares
and Shaw-nees also, I had to make arrangements to feed from the
time of their arrival at the Sac and Fox Agency. But from all the

<p>It has been some time since I wrote you and to fill my promise I
again drop you a line. I presume you feel a lively interest in
whatever relates to the Indians. The 1st. Regt. is now mustered
into the service and will probably to-day number something over a
minimum Regt. It is composed entirely of Creeks and Seminoles,
eight companys of the former and two of the latter.</p>
<p>I have understood that the report of the Creek Agent gave the
number of Creek men at 1990&mdash;If this is a fact it is far from
a correct statement&mdash;The actual number of Creek men over 14
years of age (refugees) will not number over 900. Some of these are
unable to be soldiers. The actual number of Seminoles (men) will
not excede 300 over 14 years of age, many of them are old and
disabled as soldiers. Thus you will see that but one Regt. could be
raised from that quarter. You are aware that the Creeks and
Seminoles speak one language nearly and are thus naturally drawn
together and they were not willing to be divided.</p>
<p>The second regt. is now forming from the various other tribes
and I have no doubt will be filled, it would have been filled long
ago, but Col. Ritchie did not repair here for a long time in fact
not till after our Regt. was raised&mdash;Adjutant Dole came here
promptly to do his duty&mdash;but in the absence of his Col. could
not facilitate his regt. without assuming a responsibility that
would have been unwise. I regret that he could not have been placed
in our regt. for he will prove a faithful and reliable officer and

<p>The condition of the Indians here at the present writing is very
favorable, sickness is abating and their spirits are reviving. I
think I have fully settled the fact of the Indians capability and
susceptibility to arive at a good state of military disipline. You
would be surprised to see our Regt. move. They accomplish the feat
of regular time step equal to any white soldier, they form in line
with dispatch and with great precission; and what is more they now
manifest a great desire to learn the entire white man's disiplin in
military matters. That they will make brave and ambitious soldiers
I have no doubt. Our country may well feel proud that these red men
have at last fell into the ranks to fight for our flag, and aid in
crushing treason. Much honor is due them. I am sorry that Dr. Kile
did not accept the appointment of Quartermaster but owing to some

Seminoles, sixty Quapaws, sixty Cherokees and full companies of
wild Delawares, Kechees, Ironeyes, Cadoes, and Kickapoos, left this
place (Leroy) yesterday for Humboldt, at which place I suppose they
will join the so much talked of Indian expedition. Although I have
not as yet fully ascertained the exact number of each Tribe,
represented in said Brigade, but they may be estimated at about
Fifteen Hundred, all of the Southern Refugee Indians who have been
fed here by the Government, besides sixty Delawares from the
Delaware Reservation, and about two Hundred Osages, the latter of
which I have been assured will be increased to about four or five
hundred, ere they get through the Osage Nation ...</p>

tried to fix the blame upon Weer [Weer to Moonlight, June 23, 1862,
<i>ibid</i>., 446]. The newspaper account of the whole course of
affairs may be given, roughly paraphrased, thus: Doubleday,
knowing, perhaps, that Weer was to supersede him and that his time
for action was short, "withdrew his detachment from Missouri,
concentrated them near Iola, Kansas, and thence directed them to
march to the mouth of Shoal Creek, on Spring River, himself taking
charge of the convoying of a train of forty days supplies to the
same place ..." He arrived June 4. Then, "indefatigible in
forwarding the preparations for a blow upon the camp of
organization which the rebels had occupied unmolested on Cowskin
Prairie," he made his plans for further advance. At that moment
came the news that Weer had superseded him and had ordered him to
stop all movement south. He disregarded the order and struck, even
though not fully prepared [<i>Daily Conservative</i>, June 13,
1862].</p>

<h2>V. THE MARCH TO TAHLEQUAH AND THE RETROGRADE MOVEMENT OF THE
"WHITE AUXILIARY"</h2>
<p>Towards the end of June, the various elements designed to
comprise the First Indian Expedition had encamped at Baxter
Springs<a id="footnotetag312" name="footnotetag312"></a><a href=
"#footnote312"><sup>312</sup></a> and two brigades formed. As
finally organized, the First Brigade was put under the command of
Colonel Salomon and the Second, of Colonel William R. Judson. To
the former, was attached the Second Indian Regiment, incomplete,
and, to the latter, the First. Brigaded with the Indian regiments
was the white auxiliary that had been promised and that the Indians
had almost pathetically counted upon to assist them in their
straits. Colonel Weer's intention was not to have the white and red
people responsible for the same duties nor immediately march
together. The red were believed to be excellent for scouting and,
as it would be necessary to scout far and wide all the way down
into the Indian Territory, the country being full of bushwhackers,
also, most likely, of the miscellaneous forces of General Rains,
Colonel Coffee, and Colonel Stand Watie, they were to be reserved
for that work.</p>
<p>The forward movement of the Indian Expedition began at daybreak
on the twenty-eighth of June. It was then that the First Brigade
started, its white contingent, "two sections Indiana Battery, one
battalion of</p>

taking the military road across the Quapaw Strip and entering the
Indian Territory, unmolested. A day's journey in the rear and

unmounted.<a id="footnotetag314" name="footnotetag314"></a><a href=

proceeded to Hudson's Crossing of the Neosho River, where it halted
to await the coming of supply trains from Fort Scott. In the

followed, a day apart, by the mounted men of the First under Major
William A. Phillips,<a id="footnotetag315" name=

Spring River, from thence to march southward and scour the country
thoroughly between Grand River and the Missouri state line.</p>
<p>The halt at Hudson's Crossing occupied the better part of two
days and then the main body of the Indian Expedition resumed its
forward march. It crossed the Neosho and moved on, down the west
side of Grand River, to a fording place, Carey's Ford, at which
point, it passed over to the east side of the river and camped, a
short distance from the ford, at Round Grove, on Cowskin Prairie,

<p>Do not send any one just now to command the Trans-Mississippi
District. It will bring trouble to this army. Hindman has been sent
there temporarily. Price will be on to see you soon.</p>

<p>Hindman had assumed the command of the Trans-Mississippi
Department.<a id="footnotetag321" name=
"footnotetag321"></a><a href="#footnote321"><sup>321</sup></a> As
an Arkansan, deeply moved by the misfortunes and distress of his
native state, he had stepped into Van Dorn's place with alacrity,
intent upon forcing everything within his reach to subserve the
interests of the Confederate cause in that particular part of the
southern world. To the Indians and to their rights, natural or
acquired, he was as utterly indifferent as were most other American
men and all too soon that fact became obvious, most obvious,
indeed, to General Pike, the one person who had, for reasons best
known to himself, made the Indian cause his own.</p>
<p>General Hindman took formal command of the Trans-Mississippi
Department at Little Rock, May 31. It was a critical moment and he
was most critically placed; for he had not the sign of an army,
Curtis's advance was only about thirty-five miles away, and
Arkansas was yet, in the miserable plight in which Van Dorn had
left her in charge of Brigadier-general J.S. Roane, it is true, but
practically denuded of troops. Pike was at Fort McCulloch, and he
had a force not wholly to be despised.<a id="footnotetag322" name=

<p><i>Department</i> seems to be the more proper word to use to
designate Hindman's command, although <i>District</i> and
<i>Department</i> are frequently used interchangeably in the
records. In Hindman's time and in Holmes's, the Trans-Mississippi
Department was not the same as the Trans-Mississippi District of
Department No. 2 [See Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff, to Hindman,
July 17, 1862, <i>Official Records</i>, vol. xiii, 855]. On the
very date of Hindman's assignment, the boundaries of his command
were defined as follows:</p>
<p>"The boundary of the Trans-Mississippi Department will embrace
the States of Missouri and Arkansas, including Indian Territory,
the State of Louisiana west of the Mississippi, and the State of
Texas."&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>., 829.</p>

<p>Yet Hindman did, in a sense, despise it and, from the start, he
showed a tendency to disparage Pike's abilities and efforts. On the
nineteenth of June, he reported to Adjutant-general Cooper, among
other things, that he had ordered Pike to establish his
headquarters at Fort Gibson and added, "His force does not amount
to much, but there is no earthly need of its (cont.)</p>

<p>made one of his first appeals for help and he ordered him so to
dispose of his men that some of the more efficient, the white,
might be sent to Little Rock and the less efficient, the red, moved
upward "to prevent the incursions of marauding parties," from
Kansas.<a id="footnotetag323" name="footnotetag323"></a><a href=
"#footnote323"><sup>323</sup></a> The orders were repeated about a
fortnight later; but Pike had already complied to the best of his
ability, although not without protest<a id="footnotetag324" name=
"footnotetag324"></a><a href="#footnote324"><sup>324</sup></a> for
he had collected his brigade and accoutered it by his own energies
and his own contrivances solely. Moreover, he had done it for the
defence of Indian Territory exclusively.</p>
<p>Included among the marauders, whose enterprises General Hindman
was bent upon checking, were Doubleday's men; for, as General
Curtis shrewdly surmised,<a id="footnotetag325" name=
"footnotetag325"></a><a href="#footnote325"><sup>325</sup></a> some
inkling of Doubleday's contemplated maneuvers had most certainly
reached Little Rock. Subsequently, when the Indian Expedition was
massing at Baxter Springs, more vigorous measures than any yet
taken were prepared for and all with the view of delaying or
defeating it. June 23, Pike ordered Colonel Douglas H. Cooper to
repair to the country north of the Canadian River and to take
command of all troops, except Jumper's Seminole battalion, that
should be there or placed there.<a id="footnotetag326" name=

<p>Carruth and Martin reported to Coffin, August 2, 1862, that the
Indians did practically all the fighting on the Federal side. In
minor details, their account differed considerably from Weer's.</p>
<p>"When near Grand Saline, Colonel Weer detached parts of the 6th,
9th, and 10th Kansas regiments, and sent the 1st Indian regiment in
advance. By a forced night march they came up to the camp of
Colonel Clarkson, completely surprising him, capturing all his
supplies, and taking one hundred prisoners; among them the colonel
himself.</p>
<p>"The Creek Indians were first in the fight, led by Lieutenant
Colonel Wattles and Major Ellithorpe. We do not hear that any white
man fired a gun unless it was to kill the surgeon of the 1st Indian
regiment. We were since informed that one white man was killed by
the name of McClintock, of the 9th Kansas regiment. In reality, it
was a victory gained by the 1st Indian regiment; and while the
other forces would, no doubt, have acted well, it is the height of
injustice to claim this victory for the
whites...."&mdash;Commissioner of Indian Affairs, <i>Report</i>,

<p>The Confederates were worsted and lost their train and many
prisoners. Among the prisoners was Clarkson himself. His battalion
was put to flight and in that circumstance lay the worst aspect of
the whole engagement; for the routed men fled towards Tahlequah and
spread consternation among the Indians gathered there, also among
those who saw them by the way or heard of them. Thoroughly
frightened the red men sought refuge within the Federal lines. Such
conduct was to be expected of primitive people, who invariably
incline towards the side of the victor; but, in this case, it was
most disastrous to the Confederate Indian alliance. For the second
time since the war began, Colonel John Drew's enlisted men defected
from their own ranks<a id="footnotetag337" name=

with the exception of a small body under Captain Pickens
Benge,<a id="footnotetag338" name="footnotetag338"></a><a href=

regiment, which had not previously been filled up, had soon the
requisite number of men<a id="footnotetag339" name=
"footnotetag339"></a><a href="#footnote339"><sup>339</sup></a> and
there were more to spare. Indeed, during the days that followed, so

were opened for starting a third regiment of Indian Home
Guards.<a id="footnotetag340" name="footnotetag340"></a><a href=

<p>management of Indian affairs, particularly as those affairs
might be concerned with the future attitude of the Cherokee Nation.
The programme comprised instructions that emanated from both civil
and military sources. The special Indian agents, Carruth and
Martin, had been given suitable tasks to perform and the
instructions handed them have already been commented upon.
Personally, these two men were very much disposed to magnify the
importance of their own position and to resent anything that looked
like interference on the part of the military. As a matter of fact,
the military men treated them with scant courtesy and made little

<p>The military instructions for the management of Indian affairs
outlined a policy exceedingly liberal, a policy that proceeded upon
the assumption that stress of circumstances had conditioned the
Indian alliance with the Confederacy. This idea was explicitly
conveyed in a communication from Weer, through his acting assistant
adjutant-general, to John Ross, and again in the orders issued to
Salomon and Judson. Ross and his people were to be given an
opportunity to return to their allegiance, confident that the
United States government would henceforth protect them.<a id=

tolerated between Indian and Indian. Our policy toward the rebel
portion must be a subject of anxious consideration, and its
character will to a great degree be shaped by yourself (Judson) in
conjunction with Colonel Salomon. No settled policy can at present
be marked out. Give all questions their full share of

somewhat his equanimity and gave him the impression that Ross,
thoroughly anti-secessionist at heart himself, was acting
diplomatically and biding his time.<a id="footnotetag355" name=

<p>There were other reasons, more purely military, why a certain
haste was rather necessary. Some of those reasons inspired Colonel
Weer to have the country around about him well reconnoitered. On
the fourteenth of July, he sent out two detachments. One, led by
Major W.T. Campbell, was to examine "the alleged position of the

ostensibly still serving the Confederacy. It was a time of crisis
both with them and with him; for their leaders had just been
summoned by Colonel Cooper, now in undisputed command north of the
Canadian, to report immediately for duty at Fort Davis, his
headquarters. Whatever was to be done would have to be done
quickly. There was no time to lose and Greeno decided the matter

clever expedient. He made the commissioned men all prisoners of
war<a id="footnotetag361" name="footnotetag361"></a><a href=

the Principal Chief, who was likewise in a dilemma, he having

beforehand and that victor and victim had been in collusion with
each other all the way through.</p>
<p>Up to this point the Indian Expedition can be said to have met
with more than a fair measure of success; but its troubles were now
to begin or rather to assert themselves; for most of them had been
present since the very beginning. Fundamental to everything else
was the fact that it was summer-time and summer-time, too, in a
prairie region. Troops from the north, from Wisconsin and from
Ohio, were not acclimated and they found the heat of June and July
almost insufferable. There were times when they lacked good
drinking water, which made bad matters worse. The Germans were
particularly discontented and came to despise the miserable company
in which they found themselves. It was miserable, not so much
because it was largely Indian, but because it was so ill-equipped
and so disorderly. At Cowskin Prairie, the scouts had to be called
in, not because their work was finished, but because they and their
ponies were no longer equal to it.<a id="footnotetag363" name=

had played out for the simple reason that they were not well fitted

<p>to fall with crushing weight upon the noble men composing the
command. Some one must act, and that at once, or starvation and
capture were the imminent hazards that looked us in the face.</p>
<p>As next in command to Colonel Weer, and upon his express refusal
to move at all for the salvation of his troops, I felt the
responsibility resting upon me.</p>
<p>I have arrested Colonel Weer and assumed command.</p>
<p>The causes leading to this arrest you all know. I need not
reiterate them here. Suffice to say that we are 160 miles from the
base of operations, almost entirely through an enemy's country, and
without communication being left open behind us. We have been
pushed forward thus far by forced and fatiguing marches under the
violent southern sun without any adequate object. By Colonel Weer's
orders we were forced to encamp where our famishing men were unable
to obtain anything but putrid, stinking water. Our reports for
disability and unfitness for duty were disregarded; our cries for
help and complaints of unnecessary hardships and suffering were
received with closed ears. Yesterday a council of war, convened by
the order of Colonel Weer, decided that our only safety lay in
falling back to some point from which we could reopen communication
with our commissary depot. Colonel Weer overrides and annuls the
decision of that council, and announces his determination not to
move from this point. We have but three days' rations on hand and
an order issued by him putting the command on half rations. For
nearly two weeks we have no communication from our rear. We have no
knowledge when supply trains will reach us, neither has Colonel
Weer. Three sets of couriers, dispatched at different times to find
these trains and report, have so far made no report. Reliable
information has been received that large bodies of the enemy were
moving to our rear, and yet we lay here idle. We are now and ever
since our arrival here have been entirely without vegetables or
healthy food for our troops. I have stood with arms folded and seen
my men faint and fall away from me like the leaves of autumn
because I thought myself powerless to save them.</p>
<p>I will look upon this scene no longer. I know the responsibility
I have assumed. I have acted after careful thought</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg

<p>and deliberation. Give me your confidence for a few days, and
all that man can do, and with a pure purpose and a firm faith that
he is right, shall be done for the preservation of the troops.</p>

<p>Headquarters Indian Expedition,<br />
Camp on Wolf Creek, Cherokee Nation, July 20, 1862.<br />
Brig. Gen. James G. Blunt,</p>
<p><i>Commanding Department of Kansas</i>:</p>
<p>Sir: I have the honor to report that I have arrested Col.
William Weer, commanding the Indian Expedition, and have assumed
command. Among the numerous reasons for this step a few of the
chief are as follows:</p>
<p>From the day of our first report to him we have found him a man
abusive and violent in his intercourse with his fellow-officers,
notoriously intemperate in habits, entirely disregarding military
usages and discipline, always rash in speech, act, and orders,
refusing to inferior officers and their reports that consideration
which is due an officer of the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>Starting from Cowskin Prairie on the 1st instant, we were pushed
rapidly forward to the vicinity of Fort Gibson, on the Arkansas
River, a distance of 160 miles from Fort Scott. No effort was made
by him to keep communication open behind us. It seemed he desired
none. We had but twenty-three days' rations on hand. As soon as he
reached a position on Grand River 14 miles from Fort Gibson his
movements suddenly ceased. We could then have crossed the Arkansas
River, but it seemed there was no object to be attained in his
judgment by such a move. There we lay entirely idle from the 9th to
the 19th. We had at last reached the point when we had but three
days' rations on hand. Something must be done. We were in a barren
country, with a large force of the enemy in front of us, a large
and now impassable river between us, and no news from our train or
from our base of operations for twelve days. What were we to do?
Colonel Weer called a council of war, at which he stated that the
Arkansas River was now impassable to our forces; that a train
containing commissary stores had been expected for three days; that
three different sets of couriers sent out some time previous
had</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg
142]</span>
<p>entirely failed to report; that he had been twelve days entirely
without communication with or from the department, and that he had
received reliable information that a large force of the enemy were
moving to our rear via the Verdigris River for the purpose of
cutting off our train.</p>
<p>Upon this and other information the council of war decided that
our only safety lay in falling back to some point where we could
reopen communication and learn the whereabouts of our train of
subsistence. To this decision of the council he at the time
assented, and said that he would arrange with the commanders of
brigades the order of march. Subsequently he issued an order
putting the command on half rations, declaring that he would not
fall back, and refused utterly, upon my application, to take any
steps for the safety or salvation of his command. I could but
conclude that the man was either insane, premeditated treachery to
his troops, or perhaps that his grossly intemperate habits long
continued had produced idiocy or monomania. In either case the
command was imperiled, and a military necessity demanded that
something be done, and that without delay. I took the only step I
believed available to save your troops. I arrested this man, have
drawn charges against him, and now hold him subject to your
orders.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th I commenced a retrograde march and
have fallen back with my main force to this point.</p>
<p>You will see by General Orders, No. 1, herewith forwarded, that
I have stationed the First and Second Regiments Indian Home Guards
as a corps of observation along the Grand and Verdigris Rivers;
also to guard the fords of the Arkansas. Yesterday evening a
courier reached me at Prior Creek with dispatches saying that a
commissary train was at Hudson's Crossing, 75 miles north of us,
waiting for an additional force as an escort. Information also
reaches me this morning that Colonel Watie, with a force of 1,200
men, passed up the east side of Grand River yesterday for the
purpose of cutting off this train. I have sent out strong
reconnoitering parties to the east of the river, and if the
information proves reliable will take such further measures as I
deem best for its security.</p>
<p>I design simply to hold the country we are now in, and will make
no important moves except such as I may deem necessary for the
preservation of this command until I receive specific</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg
143]</span>
<p>instructions from you. I send Major Burnett with a small escort
to make his way through to you. He will give you more at length the
position of this command, their condition, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br />
F. Salomon, <i>Colonel Ninth Wis. Vols</i>.,<br />
<i>Comdg. Indian Expedition</i>.</p>
<p>Salomon's insubordination brought the Indian Expedition in its
original form to an abrupt end, much to the disgust and righteous
indignation of the Indian service. The arrest of Colonel Weer threw
the whole camp into confusion,<a id="footnotetag372" name=
"footnotetag372"></a><a href="#footnote372"><sup>372</sup></a> and
it was some hours before anything like order could be restored. A
retrograde movement of the white troops had evidently been earlier
resolved upon and was at once undertaken. Of such troops, Salomon
assumed personal command and ordered them to begin a march
northward at two o'clock on the morning of the nineteenth.<a id=
"footnotetag373" name="footnotetag373"></a><a href=
"#footnote373"><sup>373</sup></a> At the same time, he established
the troops, he was so brutally abandoning, as a corps of
observation on or near the Verdigris and Grand Rivers. They were
thus expected to cover his retreat, while he, unhampered, proceeded
to Hudson's Crossing.<a id="footnotetag374" name=
"footnotetag374"></a><a href="#footnote374"><sup>374</sup></a></p>
<p>With the departure of Salomon and subordinate commanders in
sympathy with his retrograde movement, Robert W. Furnas, colonel of
the First Indian, became the ranking officer in the field.
Consequently it was his duty to direct the movements of the troops
that remained. The troops were those of the three Indian regiments,
the third of which had not yet been formally recognized and
accepted by the government. Not all of these troops were in camp
when the arrest of Weer took place. One of the last official acts
of Weer as</p>

<h2>VI. GENERAL PIKE IN CONTROVERSY WITH GENERAL HINDMAN</h2>
<p>The retrograde movement of Colonel Salomon and the white
auxiliary of the Indian Expedition was peculiarly unfortunate and
ill-timed since, owing to circumstances now to be related in
detail, the Confederates had really no forces at hand at all
adequate to repel invasion. On the thirty-first of May, as earlier
narrated in this work, General Hindman had written to General Pike
instructing him to move his entire infantry force of whites and
Woodruff's single six-gun battery to Little Rock without delay. In
doing this, he admitted that, while it was regrettable that Pike's
force in Indian Territory should be reduced, it was imperative that
Arkansas should be protected, her danger being imminent. He further
ordered, that Pike should supply the command to be sent forward
with subsistence for thirty days, should have the ammunition
transported in wagons, and should issue orders that not a single
cartridge be used on the journey.<a id="footnotetag392" name=
"footnotetag392"></a><a href="#footnote392"><sup>392</sup></a></p>
<p>To one of Pike's proud spirit, such orders could be nothing
short of galling. He had collected his force and everything he
possessed appertaining to it at the cost of much patience, much
labor, much expense. Untiring vigilance had alone made possible the
formation of his brigade and an unselfish willingness to advance
his own funds had alone furnished it with quartermaster and
commissary stores. McCulloch and Van</p>

"#footnote393"><sup>393</sup></a> each in turn had diverted his
supplies from their destined course, yet he had borne with it all,
uncomplainingly. He had even broken faith with the Indian nations
at Van Dorn's instance; for, contrary to the express terms of the
treaties that he had negotiated, he had taken the red men across
the border, without their express consent, to fight in the Pea
Ridge campaign. And with what result? Base ingratitude on the part
of Van Dorn, who, in his official report of the three day
engagement, ignored the help rendered<a id="footnotetag394" name=
"footnotetag394"></a><a href="#footnote394"><sup>394</sup></a> and
left Pike to bear the stigma<a id="footnotetag395" name=
"footnotetag395"></a><a href="#footnote395"><sup>395</sup></a> of
Indian atrocities alone.</p>
<p>With the thought of that ingratitude still rankling in his
breast, Pike noted additional features of Hindman's first
instructions to him, which were, that he should advance his Indian
force to the northern border of Indian Territory and hold it there
to resist invasion from Kansas. He was expected to do this
unsupported</p>

<p>How great was that stigma can be best understood from the
following: "The horde of Indians scampered off to the mountains
from whence they had come, having murdered and scalped many of the

heights of Big Mountain, near Elk Horn, where he was of no use to
the battle of the succeeding day, and whence he fled, between
roads, through the woods, disliked by the Confederates and detested
by the Union men; to be known in history as a son of New
Hampshire&mdash;a poet who sang of flowers and the beauties of the
sunset skies, the joys of love and the hopes of the soul&mdash;and
yet one who, in the middle of the 19th century, led a merciless,
scalping, murdering, uncontrollable horde of half-tame savages in
the defense of slavery&mdash;themselves slave-holders&mdash;against
that Union his own native State was then supporting, and against
the flag of liberty. He scarcely struck a blow in open fight....
His service was servile and corrupt; his flight was abject, and his

<p>It is quite believable that Van Dorn was the person most
responsible for Hindman's interference with Pike, although, of
course, the very seriousness and desperateness of Hindman's
situation would have impelled him to turn to the only place where
ready help was to be had. Three days prior to the time that Hindman
had been assigned to the Trans-Mississippi Department, Roane, an

suggestion<a id="footnotetag398" name="footnotetag398"></a><a href=
"#footnote398"><sup>398</sup></a> all the white forces he could
spare, Roane having practically none of his own. Pike had refused
the request, if request it was, and in refusing it, had represented
how insufficient his forces actually were for purposes of his own
department and how exceedingly difficult had been the task, which
was his and his alone, of getting them together. At the time of
writing he had not a single dollar of public money for his army and
only a very limited amount of ammunition and other supplies.<a id=

<p>affairs in the West and should be dealt with analytically, yet
also as a whole; since no paraphrase, no mere synopsis of contents
could ever do the subject justice. From the facts presented, it is
only too evident that very little had been attempted or done by the
Richmond authorities for the Indian regiments. Neither officers nor
men had been regularly or fully paid. And not all the good
intentions, few as they were, of the central government had been
allowed realization. They had been checkmated by the men in control
west of the Mississippi. In fact, the army men in Arkansas had
virtually exploited Pike's command, had appropriated for their own
use his money, his supplies, and had never permitted anything to
pass on to Indian Territory, notwithstanding that it had been
bought with Indian funds, "that was fit to be sent anywhere else."
The Indian's portion was the "refuse," as Pike so truly, bitterly,
and emphatically put it, or, in other words of his, the "crumbs"
that fell from the white man's table.</p>
<p>Pike's compliance with Hindman's orders was only partial and he
offered not the vestige of an apology that it was so. What he did
send was Dawson's<a id="footnotetag402" name=

infantry regiment and Woodruff's battery which went duly on to
Little Rock with the requisite thirty days' subsistence and the
caution that not a single cartridge was to be fired along the way.
The caution Pike must have repeated in almost ironical vein; for
the way to Little Rock lay through Indian Territory and cartridges
like everything else under Pike's control had been collected solely
for its defense.</p>

not the slightest observation in his</p>

<p>reply. His silence was ominous. Perhaps it was intended as a
warning to Hindman not to encroach too far upon his department; but
that is mere conjecture; inasmuch as Pike had not yet seen fit to
question outright Hindman's authority over himself. As if
anticipating an echo from Little Rock of criticisms that were rife
elsewhere, he ventured an explanation of his conduct in
establishing himself in the extreme southern part of Indian
Territory and towards the west and in fortifying on an open
prairie, far from any recognized base.<a id="footnotetag403" name=
"footnotetag403"></a><a href="#footnote403"><sup>403</sup></a> He
had gone down into the Red River country, he asserted, in order to
be near Texas where supplies might be had in abundance and where,
since he had no means of defence, he would be safe from attack. He
deplored the seeming necessity of merging his department in another
and larger one. His reasons were probably many but the one reason
he stressed was, for present purposes, the best he could have
offered. It was, that the Indians could not be expected to render
to him as a subordinate the same obedience they had rendered to him
as the chief officer in command. Were his authority to be
superseded in any degree, the Indians would naturally infer that
his influence at Richmond had declined, likewise his power to
protect them and their interests.</p>

halting on the 'Little Blue', an unknown thread of a stream, twenty

take position at Camp McIntosh, 17 miles this side of Fort Cobb,
where, with Hart's Spies, 40 in number, it will send out parties to
the Wichita Mountains and up the False Wichita, and prevent, if
possible, depredations on the frontier of Texas.</p>

quiet, all the Comanches this side of the Staked Plains being
friendly, and the Kiowas<a id="footnotetag408" name=

<p>Included in Russell's report there might well have been much
interesting data respecting the condition of the troops that Pike
was parting with; for it can scarcely be said that he manifested
any generosity in sending them forth. He obeyed the letter of his
order and ignored its spirit. He permitted no guns to be taken out
of the Territory that had been paid for with money that he had
furnished. Dawson's regiment had not its full quota of men, but
that was scarcely Pike's fault. Neither was it his fault that its
equipment was so sadly below par that it could make but very slow
progress on the nine hundred mile march between Fort McCulloch and
Little Rock. Moreover, the health of the</p>

wagon,<a id="footnotetag411" name="footnotetag411"></a><a href=

there would come a call decreasing Pike's command.</p>
<p>So slowly and laboriously did Dawson's regiment progress that
Hindman, not hearing either of it or of Woodruff's battery, which
was slightly in advance, began to have misgivings as to the fate of
his orders of May 31. He, therefore, repeated them in substance, on
June 17, with the additional specific direction that Pike should
"move at once to Fort Gibson." That order Pike received June 24,
the day following his issuance of instructions to his next in
command, Colonel D.H. Cooper, that he should hasten to the country
north of the Canadian and there take command of all forces except
Chief Jumper's.</p>

Pike to pen another lengthy letter<a id="footnotetag412" name=

description and protest. Interspersed through it were his
grievances, the same that were recited in the letter of June 8, but

declared that he had done all he could to expedite the movement of
his troops. The odds were unquestionably against him. His Indians
were doing duty in different places. Most of the men of his white

reorganization, preliminary to marching, be possible. He was short
of transportation and half of what he had was unserviceable.</p>
<p>Of his available Indian force, he had made what disposition to
him seemed best. He had ordered the newly-organized First Choctaw
Regiment, under Colonel Sampson Folsom, to Fort Gibson and had
assigned Cooper to the command north of the Canadian, which meant,
of course, the Cherokee country. Cooper's own regiment was the
First Choctaw and Chickasaw, of which, two companies, proceeding
from Scullyville, had already posted themselves in the upper part
of the Indian Territory, where also were the two Cherokee
regiments, Watie's and Drew's. The remaining eight companies of the
First Choctaw and Chickasaw were encamped near Fort McCulloch and
would have, before moving elsewhere, to await the reorganization of
their regiment, now near at hand. However, Cooper was not without
hope that he could effect reorganization promptly and take at least
four companies to join those that had just come from Scullyville.
There were six companies in the Chickasaw Battalion, two at Fort
Cobb and four on the march to Fort McCulloch; but they would all
have to be left within their own country for they were averse to
moving out of it and were in no condition to move. The three
companies of the Choctaw Battalion would also have to be left
behind in the south for they had no transportation with which to
effect a removal. The Creek commands, D.N. McIntosh's Creek

<p>June 17 might be said to mark the beginning of the real
controversy between Pike and Hindman; for, on that day, not only
did Hindman reiterate the order to hurry that aroused Pike's ire
but he encroached upon Pike's prerogative in a financial particular
that was bound, considering Pike's experiences in the past, to make
for trouble. Interference with his commissary Pike was determined
not to brook, yet, on June 17, Hindman put N. Bart Pearce in
supreme control at Fort Smith as commissary, acting quartermaster,
and acting ordnance officer.<a id="footnotetag413" name=
"footnotetag413"></a><a href="#footnote413"><sup>413</sup></a> His
jurisdiction was to extend over northwestern Arkansas and over the
Indian Territory. Now Pike had had dealings already with Pearce and
thought that he knew too well the limits of his probity. Exactly
when Pike heard of Pearce's promotion is not quite clear; but, on
the twenty-third, Hindman sent him a conciliatory note explaining
that his intention was "to stop the operations of the commissaries
of wandering companies in the Cherokee Nation, who" were
"destroying the credit of the Confederacy by the floods of
certificates they" issued and not "to restrict officers acting
under" Pike's orders.<a id="footnotetag414" name=

<p>His indignation must have been immense; but whether righteously
so or not, it was for others higher up to decide. That Pike had
some sort of a case against the men in Arkansas there can be no
question. The tale he told Secretary Randolph was a revelation such
as would have put ordinary men, if involved at all, to deepest
shame. Hindman, perforce, was the victim of accumulated resentment;
for he, personally, had done only a small part of that of which
Pike complained. In the main, Pike's report simply furnished
particulars in matters, such as the despoiling him of his hard-won
supplies, of which mention has already been made; and his chief
accusation was little more than hinted at, the gist of it being
suggested in some of his concluding sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... I struggled for a good while before I got rid of the curse
of dependence for subsistence, transportation, and forage on
officers at Fort Smith. I cannot even get from that place the
supplies I provide myself and hardly my own private stores. My
department quartermaster and commissary are fully competent to
purchase what we need, and I mean they shall do it. I have set my
face against all rascality and swindling and keep contractors in
wholesome fear, and have made it publicly known by advertisement
that I prefer to purchase of the farmer and producer and do not
want any contractors interposed between me and them. My own
officers will continue to purchase subsistence, transportation,
forage, and whatever else I need until I am ordered to the contrary
by you, and when that order comes it will be answered by my
resignation. Mr. White's<a id="footnotetag418" name=
"footnotetag418"></a><a href="#footnote418"><sup>418</sup></a>
contract will not be acted under here. I have beef enough on hand
and engaged, and do not want any from him. I have had to buy bacon
at 20 to 26 cents, and he ought to be made to pay every cent of the
difference between that price and fifteen cents. I also strenuously
object to receiving mules or anything else purchased at Fort
Smith.</p>

threatening Fort Gibson, Tahlequah, and Cherokee integrity

greatly aggrieved because of Pike's delinquency in this respect,
addressed<a id="footnotetag429" name="footnotetag429"></a><a href=

in the fatal days of June.</p>
<p>In addressing General Hindman as Pike's superior officer, John
Ross did something more than make representations as to the claims,
which his nation in virtue of treaty guaranties had upon the South.
He urged the advisability of allowing the Indians to fight strictly
on the defensive and of placing them under the command of someone
who would "enjoy their confidence." These two things he would like
to have done if the protective force, which the Confederacy had
promised, were not forthcoming. The present was an opportune time
for the preferring of such a request. At least it was opportune
from the standpoint of Pike's enemies and traducers.<a id=

tantalize him that he could render his position as brigade and
department commander, intolerable. That he proceeded to do. Pike's

attending to business was in itself an annoyance and his leisurely

ordered to proceed with dispatch to Fort Gibson. The expiration of
a month and a half found him still at Fort McCulloch. He really did
not move from thence until, having sent in his resignation, he made
preparations for handing over his command to Colonel Cooper. That

<p>changing nothing as regarded the facts but showing a willingness
to let bygones be bygones. Considering how great had been his
chagrin, his indignation, and his poignant sense of ingratitude and
wrong, he rose to heights really noble. He seemed desirous, even
anxious, that the great cause in which they were both so vitally
interested should be uppermost in both their minds always and that
their differences, which, after all, were, comparatively speaking,
so very petty, should be forgotten forever. It was in the spirit of
genuine helpfulness that he wrote and also in the spirit of great
magnanimity. Pike was a man who studied the art of war zealously,
who knew the rules of European warfare, and a man, who, even in war
times, could read Napier's <i>Peninsular War</i> and succumb to its
charm. He was a classicist and a student very much more than a man
of action. Could those around him, far meaner souls many of them
than he, have only known and remembered that and, remembering it,
have made due allowances for his vagaries, all might have been
well. His generous letter of the third of July failed utterly of
its mission; but not so much, perhaps, because of Hindman's
inability to appreciate it or unwillingness to meet its writer
half-way, as because of the very seriousness of Hindman's own
military situation, which made all compromises impossible. The
things he felt it incumbent upon him to do must be done his way or
not at all. The letter of July 3 could scarcely have been received
before the objectionable orders of July 8 had been planned.</p>
<p>The last ten days of July were days of constant scouting on the
part of both the Federal and Confederate Indians but nothing of
much account resulted. Colonel W.A. Phillips of the Third Indian
Home Guard,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg
164]</span>
<p>whose command had been left by Furnas to scout around Tahlequah
and Fort Gibson, came into collision with Stand Watie's force on
the twenty-seventh at Bayou Bernard, seven miles, approximately,
from the latter place. The Confederate Cherokees lost considerably
in dead and prisoners.<a id="footnotetag443" name=
"footnotetag443"></a><a href="#footnote443"><sup>443</sup></a>
Phillips would have followed up his victory by pursuing the foe
even to the Verdigris had not Cooper, fearing that his forces might
be destroyed in detail, ordered them all south of the Arkansas and
thereby circumvented his enemy's designs. Phillips then moved
northward in the direction of Furnas's main camp on Wolf
Creek.<a id="footnotetag444" name="footnotetag444"></a><a href=
"#footnote444"><sup>444</sup></a></p>
<p>Pike had his own opinion of Cooper and Watie's daring methods of
fighting and most decidedly disapproved of their attempting to meet
the enemy in the neighborhood of Fort Gibson. That part of the
Indian Territory, according to his view of things, was not capable
of supporting an army. He discounted the ability of his men to
conquer, their equipment being so meagre. He, therefore, persisted
in advising that they should fight only on the defensive. He
advised that, notwithstanding he had a depreciatory<a id=
"footnotetag445" name="footnotetag445"></a><a href=
"#footnote445"><sup>445</sup></a> regard for the Indian Expedition,
and, both before and after the retrograde movement of Colonel
Salomon, underestimated its size and strength. He Was confident
that Cooper would have inevitably to fall back to the Canadian,
where, as he said, "the defensible country commences." Pike
objected strenuously to the courting of an open battle and, could
he have followed the bent of his own inclinations, "would have sent

<p>No doubt it was in repudiation of all responsibility for what
Cooper and Watie might eventually do that he chose soon to bring
himself, through a mistaken notion of justice and honor, into very
disagreeable prominence. Discretion was evidently not Pike's
cardinal virtue. At any rate, he was quite devoid of it when he
issued, July 31, his remarkable circular address<a id=
"footnotetag447" name="footnotetag447"></a><a href=
"#footnote447"><sup>447</sup></a> "to the Chiefs and People of the
Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, Chickasaws, and Choctaws." In that
address, he notified them that he had resigned his post as
department commander and dilated upon the causes that had moved him
to action. He shifted all blame for failure to keep faith with the
Indian nations from himself and from the Confederate government to
the men upon whom he steadfastly believed it ought to rest. He
deprecated the plundering that would bring its own retribution and
begged the red men to be patient and to keep themselves true to the
noble cause they had espoused.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remain true, I earnestly advise you, to the Confederate States
and yourselves. Do not listen to any men who tell you that the
Southern States will abandon you. They will not do it. If the enemy
has been able to come into the Cherokee country it has not been the
fault of the President; and it is but the fortune of war, and what
has happened in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and even
Arkansas. We have not been able to keep the enemy from our frontier
anywhere; but in the interior of our country we can defeat them
always.</p>
<p>Be not discouraged, and remember, above all things, that you can
have nothing to expect from the enemy. They will have no mercy on
you, for they are more merciless than wolves and more rapacious.

<p>The only fair way to judge Pike's farewell address to his Indian
charges is to consider it in the light of its effect upon them,
intended and accomplished.<a id="footnotetag448" name=
"footnotetag448"></a><a href="#footnote448"><sup>448</sup></a> So
little reason has the red man had, in the course of his long
experience with his white brother, to trust him that his faith in
that white brother rests upon a very slender foundation. Pike knew
the Indian character amazingly well and knew that he must retain
for the Confederacy the Indian's confidence at all cost. Were he to
fail in that, his entire diplomatic work would have been done in
vain. To stay the Cherokees in their desertion to the North was of
prime necessity. They had already gone over in dangerously large
numbers and must be checked before other tribes followed in their
wake. Very possibly Pike had been made aware</p>

<p>Pike gives this as the effect of his proclamation:</p>
<p>"... it effected what I desired. The Choctaw force was
immediately increased to two full regiments; the Creek force to two
regiments and two companies; the Seminole force was doubled; the
Chickasaws reorganized five companies and a sixth is being made up.
The Indians looked to me alone, and for me to vindicate myself was
to vindicate the Government. We lost half the Cherokees solely
because their moneys and supplies were
intercepted..."&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>., 904-905. See also Pike to
Holmes, December 30, 1862. Another effect was, the creation of a
prejudice self-confessed in General Holmes's mind against Pike.</p>

<p>of Chief Ross's complaint to Hindman. If so, it was all
important that he should vindicate himself. So maligned had he been
that his sensitiveness on the score of the discharge of his duties
was very natural, very pardonable. After all he had done for the
Confederacy and for the Indians, it seemed hardly right that he
should be blamed for all that others had failed to do. His motives
were pure and could not be honestly impugned by anybody. The
address was an error of judgment but it was made with the best of
intentions.</p>
<p>And so the authorities at Richmond seem to have regarded it;
that is, if the reference in President Davis's letter<a id=
"footnotetag449" name="footnotetag449"></a><a href=
"#footnote449"><sup>449</sup></a> to Pike of August 9 is to this
affair. Pike wrote to the president on the same day that he started
his address upon its rounds, but that letter,<a id="footnotetag450"
name="footnotetag450"></a><a href="#footnote450"><sup>450</sup></a>
in which he rehearsed the wrongs he had been forced to endure, also
those more recently inflicted upon him, did not reach Richmond
until September 20. His address was transmitted by Colonel D.H.
Cooper, who had taken great umbrage at it and who now charged the
author with having violated an army regulation, which prohibited
publications concerning Confederate troops.<a id="footnotetag451"

Davis took the matter under advisement and wrote to Pike a mild
reprimand. It was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The sympathy of Secretary Randolph was conceivably with Pike;
for, on the fourteenth of July, he wrote assuring him that certain
general orders had been sent out by the Adjutant and Inspector
General's Office which were "intended to prevent even the

diverting from their legitimate destination (the Department of

<h2>VII. ORGANIZATION OF THE ARKANSAS AND RED RIVER
SUPERINTENDENCY</h2>
<p>The mismanagement of southern Indian affairs of which General
Pike so vociferously complained was not solely or even to any great
degree attributable to indifference to Indian interests on the part
of the Confederate government and certainly not at all to any lack
of appreciation of the value of the Indian alliance or of the
strategic importance of Indian Territory. The perplexities of the
government were unavoidably great and its control over men and
measures, removed from the seat of its immediate influence,
correspondingly small. It was not to be expected that it would or
could give the same earnestness of attention to events on the
frontier as to those nearer the seaboard, since it was, after all,
east of the Mississippi that the great fight for political
separation from the North would have to be made.</p>
<p>The Confederate government had started out well. It had dealt
with the Indian nations on a basis of dignity and lofty honor, a
fact to be accounted for by the circumstance that Indian affairs
were at first under the State Department with Toombs at its
head;<a id="footnotetag464" name="footnotetag464"></a><a href=
"#footnote464"><sup>464</sup></a> and, in this connection, let it

<p>The preliminaries of the negotiations with the Indians have not
been enumerated here, although they might well have been. On the
twentieth of February, 1861, W.P. Chilton of Alabama offered a
resolution to inquire into the expediency of opening negotiations
[<i>Journal</i>, vol. i, 70]. March 4, Toombs urged that a special
agent be sent and offered a resolution to that effect
[<i>ibid</i>., 105]. The day following, Congress passed the
resolution [<i>ibid</i>., 107]: but left the powers and duties of
the special agent, or commissioner, undefined. Davis appointed Pike
to the position and, after Congress had expressed its wishes
regarding the mission in the act of May 21, 1861, had a copy of the
act transmitted to him as his instructions [Richardson, vol. i,
149].</p>
<p>The act of May 21, 1861, carried a blanket appropriation of
$100,000, which was undoubtedly used freely by Pike for purposes
connected with the successful prosecution of his mission. In
December, the Provisional Congress appropriated money for carrying
into effect the Pike treaties. The following letter is of interest
in connection therewith:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va., 9" December 1861.</p>
<p>Sir: On the 1st or 2nd of August 1861, after I had made Treaties
with the Creeks and Seminoles, I authorized James M.C. Smith, a
resident citizen of the Creek Nation, to raise and command a
company of Creek Volunteers, to be stationed at the North Fork
Village, in the Creek country, on the North Fork of the Canadian,
where the great road from Missouri to Texas crosses that river, to
act as a police force, watch and apprehend disaffected persons,
intercept improper communications, and prevent the driving of
cattle to Kansas.</p>
<p>The Company was soon after raised, and has remained in the
service ever since. At my appointment George W. Stidham acted as
Quartermaster and Commissary for it, and without funds from the
Government, has supplied it.</p>
<p>By the Treaty with the Seminoles, made on the 1st of August,
they agreed to furnish, and I agreed to receive, five companies of
mounted volunteers of that Nation. Two companies, and perhaps more,
were raised, and have since been received, I understand, by Col.
Cooper, and with Captain Smith's company employed in putting down
the disaffected party among the Creeks. Under my appointment, Hugh
McDonald has acted as Quartermaster and Commissary for the Seminole
companies, and made purchases without funds from the Government.
After I had made the Treaties with the Reserve Indians and
Comanches, in August 1861, Fort Cobb being about to be abandoned by
the Texan Volunteers who had held it, I authorized M. Leeper, the
Wichita agent, to enlist a small force, of twenty or twenty-five
men, under a Lieutenant, for the security of the Agency. He

since the Confederacy was most anxious to retain the Indian
friendship and it certainly could not be retained were not some
system introduced into the service. In matters of detail, local
interests, as always in American legislation, had full play. They

<p>to make Fort Smith, although quite a distance from all parts of
the Indian Territory except the Cherokee and Choctaw countries, the
permanent headquarters, also in that to compel disbursing agents to
make payments in no other funds than specie or treasury notes. The
amendment of greatest importance among those that passed muster was
the one attaching the superintendency temporarily to the western
district of Arkansas for judicial purposes. It was a measure that
could not fail to be exceedingly obnoxious to the Indians; for they
had had a long and disagreeable experience, judicially, with
Arkansas. They had their own opinion of the white man's justice,
particularly as that justice was doled out to the red man on the

April 8 most certainly exhibited an honest intention on the part of
the Confederate government to carry out the provisions of the Pike
treaties. The following constituted its principal features: With
headquarters at either Fort Smith or Van Buren, as the president
might see fit to direct, the superintendency was to embrace "all
the Indian country annexed to the Confederate States, that lies
west of Arkansas and Missouri, north of Texas, and east of Texas
and New Mexico." A superintendent and six agents were immediately
provided for, individually bonded and obligated to continue
resident during the term of office, to engage in no mercantile

<p>whatsoever, and to prosecute no Indian claims against the
government. In the choice of interpreters, preference was to be
given to applicants of Indian descent. Indian trade privileges were
to be greatly circumscribed and, in the case of the larger nations,
the complete control of the trade was to rest with the tribal
authorities. In the case, also, of those same larger nations, the
restrictions formerly placed upon land alienations were to be
removed. Intruders and spirituous liquors were to be rigidly
excluded and all payments to Indians were to be carefully
safeguarded against fraud and graft. Indian customs of citizenship
and adoption were to be respected. No foreign interference was to
be permitted. Foreign emissaries were to be dealt with as spies and
as such severely punished. The Confederate right of eminent domain
over agency sites and buildings, forts, and arsenals was to be
recognized, as also the operation of laws against counterfeiting
and of the fugitive slave law. In default of regular troops, the
Confederacy was to support an armed police for protection and the
maintenance of order. The judicial rights of the Indians were to be
very greatly extended but the Confederacy reserved to itself the
right to apprehend criminals other than Indian.</p>
<p>The intentions of the Confederate government were one thing, its
accomplishments another. The act of April 8 was not put into
immediate execution, and might have been allowed to become obsolete
had it not been for the controversy between Pike and Hindman. On
the first of August, while the subject-matter of the address, which
he had so imprudently issued to the Indians, was yet fresh in his

<p>programme of what ought to be done for Indian Territory and for
the Indians, in order that their friendly alliance might be
maintained. He urged many things and one thing very particularly.
It was the crux of them all and it was that Indian Territory should
be absolutely separated from Arkansas, in a military way, and that
no troops from either Arkansas or Texas should be stationed within
it. Other suggestions of Pike's were equally sound. Indeed, the
entire letter of the first of August was sound and in no part of it
more sound than in that which recommended the immediate appointment
of a superintendent of Indian affairs for the Arkansas and Red
River Superintendency, also the appointment of Indian agents for
all places that had none.<a id="footnotetag484" name=
"footnotetag484"></a><a href="#footnote484"><sup>484</sup></a> It
was high time that positions in connection with the conduct of
Indian affairs should be something more than sinecures.</p>
<p>Aspirants for the office of superintendent had already made
their wants known. Foremost among them was Douglas H. Cooper. It
was not in his mind, however, to separate the military command from
the civil and he therefore asked that he be made brigadier-general

of Pike removed.<a id="footnotetag485" name=

Cooper as a rude awakening.</p>

nations, give them a representation in Congress. The Cherokees had
lost no time in availing themselves of the privilege of electing a

<p>While Congress was debating the question of Indian delegate
credentials and their acceptance, a tragedy took place in Indian
Territory that more than confirmed General Pike's worst
prognostications and proved his main contention that Indian affairs
should be considered primarily upon their own merits, as an end in
themselves, and dealt with accordingly. Had the Arkansas and Red
River Superintendency been regularly established, the tragedy
referred to might never have occurred; but it was not yet
established and for many reasons, one of them being that, although
Douglas H. Cooper's appointment had been resolved upon, he had not
yet been invested with the office of superintendent.<a id=

<p>General Pike's disclosures had aroused suspicion and grave
apprehension in Richmond, so much so, indeed, that the War
Department, convinced that conditions in Indian Territory were very
far from being what they should be, decided to undertake an
investigation of its own through its Indian bureau. Promptly,
therefore, S.S. Scott, acting commissioner, departed for the West.

disorder that might at any moment extend itself to Texas and to
other parts of the Indian Territory, imperiling the whole
Confederate alliance. So long as there was a strong force at Fort
McCulloch and at the frontier posts of longer establishment,
particularly at Fort Cobb, the Reserve Indians could be held in
check with comparative ease. Hindman, ignorant of or indifferent to
the situation, no matter how serious it might be for others, had
ordered the force to be scattered and most of it withdrawn from the
Red River Valley.</p>
<p>The so-called Wichita, or Reserve, Indians, to call them by a
collective term only very recently bestowed, had ever constituted a
serious problem for the neighboring states as well as for the
central government. It was with the Confederacy as with the old
Union. The Reserve Indians were a motley horde, fragments of many
tribes that had seen better days. They were all more or less
related, either geographically or linguistically. Some of them, it
is difficult to venture upon what proportion, had been induced to
enter into negotiations with Pike and through him had formed an
alliance with the Confederacy. Apparently, those who had done this
were chiefly Tonkawas. Other Reserve Indians continued true to the
North. As time went on hostile feelings, engendered by living in
opposite camps, gained in intensity, the more especially because
white men, both north and south, encouraged them to go upon the
war-path, either against their own associates or others. Reprisals,
frequently bloody, were regularly instituted. With Pike's departure
from Fort McCulloch an opportunity for greater vindictiveness
offered, notwithstanding the fact that the Choctaw and
Chickasaw</p>

<p>troops had been left behind and were guarding the near-by
country, their own.</p>
<p>Sometime in the latter part of August or the early part of
September, Matthew Leeper, the Wichita agent under the Confederate
government, a left-over from Buchanan's days, went from the Leased
District,<a id="footnotetag494" name="footnotetag494"></a><a href=

thought, perhaps afraid of the inevitable results of the mischief
his own hands had so largely wrought, and sojourned in Texas, his
old home. The sutler left also and a man named Jones was then in
sole charge of the agency. The northern sympathizers among the
Indians thereupon aroused themselves. They had gained greatly of
late in strength and influence and their numbers had been augmented
by renegade Seminoles from Jumper's battalion and by outlawed
Cherokees. They warned Jones that Leeper would be wise not to
return. If he should return, it would be the worse for him; for
they were determined to wreak revenge upon him for all the misery
his machinations in favor of the Confederacy and for his own gain
had cost them. Presumably, Jones scorned to transmit the warning
and, in course of time, Leeper returned.</p>
<p>The twenty-third of October witnessed one of the bloodiest
scenes ever enacted on the western plains. The northern Indians of
the Reserve together with a lot of wandering Shawnees, Delawares,

Seminoles and Cherokees attacked Leeper unawares, killed him,<a id=

<h2>VIII. THE RETIREMENT OF GENERAL PIKE</h2>
<p>The tragedy at the Wichita agency brought General Pike again to
the fore. His resignation had not been accepted at Richmond as
Hindman supposed was the case at the time he released him from
custody. In fact, as events turned out, it looked as though Hindman
were decidedly more in disrepute there than was Pike. His arbitrary
procedure in the Trans-Mississippi District had been complained of
by many persons besides the one person whom he had so unmercifully
badgered. Furthermore, the circumstances of his assignment to
command were being inquired into and everything divulged was
telling tremendously against him.</p>
<p>The irregularity of Hindman's assignment to command has been
already commented upon in this narrative. Additional details may
now be given. Van Dorn had hopes, on the occasion of his own
summons to work farther east, that Sterling Price would be the one
chosen eventually to succeed him or, at all events, the one to take
the chief command of the Confederate forces in the West. He greatly
wished that upon him and upon him alone his mantle should
fall.<a id="footnotetag497" name="footnotetag497"></a><a href=
"#footnote497"><sup>497</sup></a> The filling of the position by
Hindman was to be but tentative, to last only until Price,<a id=

<p>Price was preferred to H.M. Rector; because Van Dorn felt that
Rector's influence with the people of Arkansas had greatly
declined. The truth was, Governor Rector had become incensed at the
disregard shown for Arkansas by Confederate commanders. In a recent
proclamation, he had announced that the state would henceforth look
out for herself.</p>

<p>could discuss matters personally with the president and remove
the prejudice believed to be existing in his mind against Price;
but the War Department had quite other plans developed, a rumor of
which soon reached the ears of Van Dorn. It was then he
telegraphed, begging Davis to make no appointment for the present
to the command of the Trans-Mississippi District and informing him
that Hindman had been sent there temporarily.<a id="footnotetag499"
name="footnotetag499"></a><a href="#footnote499"><sup>499</sup></a>
The request came to Richmond too late. An appointment had already
been resolved upon and made. The man chosen was John Bankhead
Magruder, a major-general in the Army of Northern Virginia.
However, as he was not yet ready to take up his new duties, Hindman
was suffered to assume the command in the West; but Magruder's
rights held over. They were held in abeyance, so to speak,
temporarily waived.<a id="footnotetag500" name=
"footnotetag500"></a><a href="#footnote500"><sup>500</sup></a></p>
<p>The controversy between Pike and Hindman would seem to have
impelled Secretary Randolph to wish to terminate early Magruder's
delay; but Magruder was loath to depart. His lack of enthusiasm
ought to have been enough to convince those sending him that he</p>

<p>The orders for Hindman to repair west, issuing from Beauregard's
headquarters, were explicit, not upon the point of the temporary
character of his appointment, but upon that of its having been made
"at the earnest solicitation of the people of Arkansas."

<p>Price, nothing daunted, continued to seek the position and
submitted plans for operations in the West. His importunities
finally forced the inquiry from Davis as to whether Magruder's
appointment had ever been rescinded and whether, since he seemed in
no hurry to avail himself of it, he really wanted the place.
Randolph reported that Magruder had no objection to the service to
which he had been ordered but desired to remain near Richmond until
the expected battle in the neighborhood should have occurred.
Randolph then suggested that Price be tendered the position of
second in command [Randolph to Davis, June 23, 1862, <i>Official
Records</i>, vol. xiii, 837], an arrangement that met with
Magruder's hearty approval [Magruder to R.E. Lee, June 26, 1862,
Ibid., 845].</p>

Trans-Mississippi conditions was very superficial, yet even he
found out that they were of a nature to admonish those concerned of
their urgency, especially in the matter of lack of arms.<a id=

indecision was apparently overcome. At any rate, on that day
Randolph wrote Pike that Magruder, the real commander of the
Trans-Mississippi District, would soon arrive at Little Rock and
that the offences of which Pike had had reason to complain would
not be repeated.</p>
<p>Letters travelled slowly in those days and Randolph's comforting
intelligence did not reach Pike in time to avert the catastrophe of
his proclamation and consequent arrest. And it was just as well,
all things considered, for Magruder never reached Little Rock. He
was a man of intemperate habits and, while <i>en route</i>, was
ordered back to Richmond to answer "charges of drunkenness and
disobedience of orders."<a id="footnotetag502" name=

President Davis was still possessed of the notion that frontier
affairs could be best conducted by men who had no local attachments
there. Late events had all too surely lent weight to his theory.

illogical; for loyalty to the particular home state constituted the
strongest asset that the Confederacy had. It was the lode-star that

superior officers and had arrived at a conclusion distinctly
favorable to Pike. He frankly confessed as much weeks afterwards.

Territory.</p>
<p>It finally dawned upon Pike that it was useless to argue any
longer upon the matters in dispute between him and Hindman, for
Holmes had pre-judged the case. Moreover, Holmes was beginning to
appreciate the advantage of being in a position where he could, by
ignoring Pike's authority and asserting his own, be much the gainer
in a material way. How he could have reconciled such an attitude
with the instructions he had received from Randolph it is
impossible to surmise. The instructions, whether verbal or written,
must have been in full accord with the secretary's letter to Pike
of the fourteenth of July, which, although Pike was as yet ignorant
of it, had explicitly said that no supplies for Indian Territory
should be diverted from their course and that there should be no
interference whatever with Pike's somewhat peculiar command.<a id=

outside the limits of their own country. Service outside was to be
deprecated, first, last, and always. Indeed, it was in response to
a suggestion from Pike, made in the autumn of 1861, that the Indian
Territory ought to be regarded as a thing apart, to be held for the
Confederacy most certainly but not to be involved in the warfare
outside, that Pike's department had been created and no

Pike's resignation.<a id="footnotetag513" name=

better proof could anyone want that Pike was sustained at
headquarters? What that view of the matter may have meant in
emboldening him to his later excessively independent actions must
be left to the reader's conjecture. It never occurred to Pike that
if his resignation had been refused, it had probably been refused
upon the supposition that, with Hindman out of the way, all would
be well. One good reason for thinking that that was the Richmond
attitude towards the affair is the fact that no record of anything
like immediate and formal action upon the resignation is
forthcoming. Pike heard that it had been refused and positively,
which was very gratifying; but it is far more likely that it had
been put to one side and purposely; in order that, since Pike was
unquestionably the best man for Indian Territory, all difficulties
might be left to adjust themselves, the less said about Hindman's

<p>There is something very peculiar about the acceptance or
non-acceptance of Pike's resignation. Randolph wrote to Holmes,
October 27, 1862, these words: "... General Pike's resignation
having been accepted, you will be left without a commanding officer
in the Indian Territory..." [<i>Official Records</i>, vol. xiii,
906]. A letter endorsement, made by Randolph, on or later than
September 19th, was to this effect: "General Pike's resignation has
not yet been accepted" [<i>ibid</i>., liii, supplement, 821], and
another, made by him, November 5th, to this: "Accept General Pike's
resignation, and notify him of it" [<i>ibid</i>., 822].</p>

<p>vigor and order was shortly restored both north and south of the
Arkansas. Guerrilla warfare was summarily suppressed, marauding
stopped, and the perpetrators of atrocities so deservedly punished
that all who would have imitated them lost their taste for such
fiendish sport. As far north as the Moravian Mission, the
Confederates were undeniably in possession; but, at that juncture,
Holmes called Hindman to other scenes. A sort of apathy then

valuable Allies and in no case have they as yet faltered, untill
ordered to retire, the prejudice once existing against them is fast
disappearing from our Army and it is now generaly conceded that
they will do good service in our border warfare. This we have never
doubted and confident as we have been of their fitness for border
warfare we have been content to await, untill they had proven to

<p>Such was the condition of affairs when Pike emerged from his
self-imposed retreat in Texas. The case for the Confederate cause
among the Indians was becoming desperate. So many things that
called for apprehension were occurring. Cooper and Rains were both
in disgrace, the failure of the recent campaign having been
attributed largely to their physical unfitness for duty. Both were
now facing an investigation of charges for drunkenness. Moreover,
the brutal attack upon and consequent murder of Agent Leeper had
just shocked the community. Hearing of that murder and considering
that he was still the most responsible party in Indian Territory,
General Pike made preparations to proceed forthwith to the Leased
District. His plans were frustrated by his own arrest at the
command of General Holmes.</p>
<p>His unfriendliness to Pike was in part due to Holmes's own
necessities. It was to his interest to assert authority over the
man who could procure supplies for Indian Territory and when
occasion offered, if that man should dare to prove obdurate, to
ignore his position altogether. Nevertheless, Holmes had not seen

conspiring with Texan Unionists against the Confederacy. To further
his own designs, Holmes chose to credit the rumors and made them
subserve the one and the same end; for he needed Pike's ammunition
and he wanted Pike himself out of the way. He affected to believe
that Pike was a traitor and, when he reappeared as brigade
commander, to consider that he had unlawfully reassumed his old
functions. Accordingly, he issued an order to Roane,<a id=

Then, as once before, his reported resignation saved him from long
confinement and from extreme ignominy. On the fifth of November,
President Davis instructed the adjutant-general to accept Pike's
resignation forthwith and five days thereafter,<a id=
"footnotetag543" name="footnotetag543"></a><a href=
"#footnote543"><sup>543</sup></a> before the arrest had actually
taken place, Holmes advised Hindman that he had better let Pike go
free so soon as he should leave the Indian country; inasmuch as his
resignation was now an assured thing.<a id="footnotetag544" name=
"footnotetag544"></a><a href="#footnote544"><sup>544</sup></a>
Holmes evidently feared to let the release take place within the
limits of Pike's old command; for some of the Indians were still
devotedly attached to him and were still pinning their faith upon
his plighted word. John Jumper and his Seminole braves were among
those most loyal to Pike; and Holmes was afraid that wholesale
desertions from their ranks would follow inevitably Pike's
degradation. Many desertions had already occurred, ostensibly
because of lack of food and raiment. Commissioner Scott had
complained to Holmes of the Indian privations<a id="footnotetag545"
name="footnotetag545"></a><a href="#footnote545"><sup>545</sup></a>
and Holmes had been forced to concede, although only at the
eleventh hour, the Indian claim to some consideration. He had
arbitrarily shared tribal quota of supplies, bought with tribal
money, with white troops and had lamely excused himself by saying
that he had done it to prevent</p>

the charge of favoritism. One other offence of which Holmes was
guilty he did not attempt to palliate, the taking of the Indians
out of their own country without their consent. To the very last
Pike had expostulated<a id="footnotetag547" name=

against such violation of treaty promises; but Holmes and Hindman
were deaf alike to entreaty and to reprimand.</p>
<p>General Pike, poet and student, was now finally deprived of his
command and the Indians left to their own devices or at the mercy
of men, who could not be trusted or were not greatly needed
elsewhere. No one attempted any longer to conceal the truth that
alliance with the Indians was a supremely selfish consideration,
and nothing more, on the part of those who coveted Indian Territory
because of its geographical position, its strategic and economic
importance. For a little while longer, Pike contended with his
enemies by means of the best weapon he had, his facile pen. His
acrimonious correspondence with the chief of those enemies, Hindman
and Holmes, reached its highest point of criticism in a letter of
December 30 to the latter. That letter summed up his grievances and
was practically his last charge. Having made it, he retired from
the scene, not to reappear until near the close of the war, when
Kirby Smith found it advantageous to re&euml;mploy him for service
among the red men.</p>

<h2>IX. THE REMOVAL OF THE REFUGEES TO THE SAC AND FOX AGENCY</h2>
<p>General Blunt's decision to restore the Indian refugees in
Kansas to their own country precipitated a word war of disagreeable
significance between the civil and military authorities. The
numbers of the refugees had been very greatly augmented in the
course of the summer, notwithstanding the fact that so large a
proportion of the men had joined the Indian Expedition. It is true
they had not all stayed with it. The retrograde movement of Colonel
Salomon and his failure later on to obey Blunt's order to the
letter<a id="footnotetag548" name="footnotetag548"></a><a href=
"#footnote548"><sup>548</sup></a> that he should return to the
support of the Indians had disheartened them and many of the
enlisted braves had deserted the ranks, as chance offered, and had
strayed back to their families in the refugee camps of southern
Kansas.<a id="footnotetag549" name="footnotetag549"></a><a href=

<p>One of the first notices of their desertion was the
following:</p>
<p>"We are getting along well, very well. The Indians seem happy
and contented, and seemingly get enough to eat and wear. At least I
hear no complaint. For the last two or three days the Indian
soldiers have been stragling back, until now there are some three
or four hundred in, and they are still coming. I held a council
with them to-day to try and find out why they are here. But they
don't seem to have any idea themselves. All I could learn was that
Old George started and the rest followed. The Col. it seems told
them to go some where else. I shall send an express to Col. Furness
in the morning to find out if possible what it means. It seems to
me it will not do to give the provisions purchased for the women
and children to the soldiers....</p>

treated like dogs, starved etc, which I must say their looks

<p>Then the numbers had been augmented in other ways. The Quapaws,
who had been early driven from their homes and once restored,<a id=
"footnotetag550" name="footnotetag550"></a><a href=
"#footnote550"><sup>550</sup></a> had left them again when they
found that their country had been denuded of all its portable
resources. It was exposed to inroads of many sorts. Even the
Federal army preyed upon it and, as all the able-bodied male
Quapaws were gradually drawn into that army, there was no way of
defending it. Its inhabitants, therefore, returned as exiles to the
country around about Leroy.<a id="footnotetag551" name=

<p>It was much the same with near neighbors of the Quapaws, with

to accept one payment of their annuities from the Confederate
agent<a id="footnotetag552" name="footnotetag552"></a><a href=

digression from the old allegiance to the United States and had

<p>This group of Shawnee refugees must be distinguished from the
so-called <i>Absentee Shawnees</i>, who also became refugees. The
Shawnees had been very much molested and disturbed during the
period of border strife following the passage of the
Kansas-Nebraska Bill. Black Bob's Band was then exceedingly
desirous of going south to dwell with the Seneca-Shawnees [Rector
to Greenwood, January 6, 1860, enclosing Dorn to Greenwood,
December 30, 1859, Indian Office General Files, <i>Neosho</i>, R
463 of 1860]. The Absentee Shawnees had taken refuge in Indian
Territory prior to the war, but were expelled immediately after it
began. They obtained supplies for a time from the Wichita Agent and
lived as refugees on Walnut Creek [Paschal Fish and other Shawnee
delegates to Cooley, December 5, 1865, Indian Office Land Files,
<i>Shawnee</i>, 1860-1865]. Later on, they seem, at least some of
them, to have gone up to the Shawnee Reserve [Dole to Coffin, July

months campaign with the Indians, and in the Creek and Cherokee
countries. Taking a deep interest in the welfare of these loyal
refugee Indians, who have sacrificed <i>all</i>, rather than fight
against our Flag, I shall be cautious and advise no policy but that
which will insure their safe restoration to their homes.</p>
<p>"The important question in your letter and that which embodies
the whole subject matter is the following&mdash;'Would it be safe
in the present condition of the country to restore the southern
refugee Indians now in southern Kansas, the women and children, the
old, feeble and infirm to their homes in the Indian country?'</p>
<p>"I answer&mdash;It would not be safe to take the women and
children to the Creek or Cherokee countries this fall for the
following reasons, 1st The corn and vegetable crop north of the
Arkansas River will not afford them subsistence for a single month.
The excessive drouth has almost completely destroyed it, and what
little would have matured is laid waste by the frequent foraging
parties of our own Army, or those of the Rebels.</p>
<p>"The amount of Military force necessary to restore and safely
protect this people in their homes would far exceed what is at
present at the disposal of the Department of Kansas; and should
they be removed to the Indian country, and our forces again be
compelled to fall back for the protection of Missouri or Kansas, it
would again involve their precipitate flight, or insure their total
destruction.</p>
<p>"Again&mdash;the effectiveness of our troops would be materially
embarased by the presence of such a vast number of timid and
helpless creatures&mdash;I base my judgment upon the following
facts&mdash;viz.:</p>
<p>"The expedition which I have been with during the summer,
exploring this country, consisted of three Brigades but containing
actually only about 6 thousand men. We routed, captured, and
pursued the fragments of several Rebel commands, driving them south
of the Arkansas River, opposite to, and in the vicinity of Fort
Gibson. This done, we found the whole of Western Arkansas alive,
and the numerous rebel squads were at once reinforced from the
guerila parties of Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and the various rebel
Indian tribes, until they now number a force of from 30 to 40
thousand strong, under the command of Pike, Drew, McIntosh, Rains,
Stand Watie and others, ready to contest the passage of the
Arkansas River at any point and in fact capable of crossing to the
north side of the river and possessing the country we have twice
passed over. Why did our command fall back? Simply because we had
not force sufficient to cross the Arkansas River and maintain our
position and because we were to remote from our dipo of
supplies.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Indians were complaining of the very
things that General Blunt suspected. For instance, in December, the
Delawares begged President Lincoln to remove Agent Johnson because
of his peculations and ungovernable temper. They also asked that
the store of Thomas Carney and Co. be ordered away from their
reservation. The latter request had been made before, the Delawares
believing that Leavenworth and Lawrence were sufficiently near for
them to trade independently [Indian Office General Files,
<i>Delaware</i>, 1862-1866]. Coffin made a contract with Stettaner
Bros. November 29, 1862, and Dole confirmed it by letter, December
13, 1862 [<i>ibid., Southern Superintendency</i>, 1863-1864].
Secretary Smith was not very well satisfied with the Stettaner
bids. They were too indefinite [<i>ibid</i>., 1859-1862, 1837].
Nevertheless, Dole, who was none too scrupulous himself,
recommended their acceptance [Dole to Smith, December 11, 1862].
Number 201 of Indian Office <i>Special Files</i> is especially rich
in matter relating to transactions of Stettaner Bros., Carney and
Stevens, and Perry Fuller, so also are the files of the Indian
Division of the Interior Department, and also, to some extent, the
House Files in the Capitol Building at Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Aside from pointing out the military inadequacy, Coffin had
chiefly argued that provisions could easily be obtained where the
refugees then were; but his opposition to Blunt's suggestion was
considerably vitiated by recommendations of his own, soon given,
for the removal of the refugees to the Sac and Fox Agency upon the
plea that they could not be supported much longer to advantage in
southern Kansas. The drouth was the main reason given; but, as Kile
had very truly said, the settlers were getting pretty tired of the
Indian exiles, whose habits were filthy and who were extremely
prodigal in their use of timber. The Sac and Fox Agency was
headquarters for the Sacs and Foxes of Mississippi, for the
Ottawas, and for the confederated Chippewas and Munsees. C.C.
Hutchinson was the agent there and there Perry Fuller, Robert S.
Stevens, and other sharpers had their base of operations.</p>
<p>The removal northward was undertaken in October and consummated
in a little less than two months; but at an expense that was
enormous and in spite of great unwillingness on the part of most of
the Indians, who naturally objected to so greatly lengthening the
distance between them and their own homes.<a id="footnotetag588"

The refugees were distributed in tribal groups rather generally
over the reserves included within the Sac and Fox Agency. At the
request of Agent Elder, the Ottawas consented to accommodate the

Cherokees, opposed to, not identified with, or not enthusiastic in

collected on the Neutral Lands. Every Confederate reverse or
Federal triumph, no matter how slight, had proved a signal for
flight. By October, the Cherokee refugees on the Neutral Lands were
reported to be nearly two thousand in number, which, allowing for
some exaggeration for the sake of getting a larger portion of

exploiting the Indian service, that the refugees at Leroy were not

On the whole, it is difficult to explain Blunt's plan for the
concentration of the Cherokee refugees at Neosho, since there were,
at the time, many indications that Hindman was considering another
advance and an invasion of southwest Missouri.</p>
<p>The November operations of the Federals in northeastern Arkansas
were directed toward arresting Hindman's progress, if progress were
contemplated. Meanwhile, Phillips with detachments of his Indian

<p>And yet it was only a short time previously that Major A.C.

enticing the Indians away from the performance of their duties.
"You will now perceive that we are on the border of the Indian

as an apologist for the Indians and attempted to exonerate
Opoeth-le-yo-ho-la from all blame [Letter to Dole, December 3,

Roman of the Indians," and the chief himself protested against the

Fourth and Fifth Indian [<i>U.S. Senate Report</i>, 41st congress,

<h2>X. NEGOTIATIONS WITH UNION INDIANS</h2>
<p>As though the Indians had not afflictions enough to endure
merely because of their proximity to the contending whites, life
was made miserable for them, during the period of the Civil War, as
much as before and after, by the insatiable land-hunger of
politicians, speculators, and would-be captains of industry, who
were more often than not, rogues in the disguise of public
benefactors. Nearly all of them were citizens of Kansas. The
cessions of 1854, negotiated by George W. Manypenny, Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, were but a prelude to the many that followed.
For years and years there was in reality never a time when some
sort of negotiation, <i>sub rosa</i> or official, was not going on.
The order of procedure was pretty much what it had always been: a
promise that the remaining land should be the Indian's, undisturbed
by white men and protected by government guarantee, forever;
encroachment by enterprising, covetous, and lawless whites;
conflict between the two races, the outraged and the aggressive;
the advent of the schemer, the man with political capital and
undeveloped or perverted sense of honor, whose vision was such that
he saw the Indian owner as the only obstacle in the way of vast
material and national progress; political pressure upon the
administration in Washington, lobbying in Congress; authorization
of negotiations with the bewildered Indians; delimitation of the
meaning of the solemn and grandly-sounding word,
<i>forever</i>.</p>
<p>When the war broke out, negotiations, begun in the</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg
222]</span>
<p>border warfare days, were still going on. This was most true as
regarded the Osages, whose immense holding in southern Kansas was
something not to be tolerated, so the politicians reasoned,
indefinitely. Petitions,<a id="footnotetag622" name=
"footnotetag622"></a><a href="#footnote622"><sup>622</sup></a>
praying that the lands be opened to white settlement were
constantly being sent in and intruders,<a id="footnotetag623" name=
"footnotetag623"></a><a href="#footnote623"><sup>623</sup></a> who
intended to force action, becoming more and more numerous and more
and more recalcitrant. One of the first official communications of
Superintendent Coffin embodied a plea for getting a treaty of
cession for which the signs had seemed favorable the previous year.
Coffin, however, discredited<a id="footnotetag624" name=
"footnotetag624"></a><a href="#footnote624"><sup>624</sup></a> a
certain Dr. J.B. Chapman, who, notwithstanding he represented white

<p>For example, take the petitions forwarded by M.W. Delahay,
surveyor-general of Kansas [Indian Office Consolidated Files,
<i>Neosho</i>, D 455 of 1861]. One of the petitions contains this
statement: "... The lands being largely settled upon and improved
and those adjacent being all claimed and settled upon by
residents&mdash;while a large emigration from Texas and other
rebellious States are forced to seek homes in a more northern and
uncongenial climate greatly against their interests and

<p>Intruders upon the Osage lands, as upon the Cherokee Neutral,
were numerous for years before the war. Agent Dorn was continually
complaining of them, chiefly because they were free-state in
politics. He again and again asked for military assistance in
removing them. See his letter to Greenwood, February 26, 1860,
<i>Neosho</i>, 1833-1865, D 107. Buchanan's administration had
conceived the idea of locating other Kansas Indians upon the huge
Osage Reserve. See Dorn to Greenwood, March 26, 1860, <i>ibid</i>.,
D 119. Apparently, the fragments of tribes in the northeastern
corner of Indian Territory had been approached on the same subject,

<p>The defection of portions of the southern tribes offered an
undreamed of opportunity for Kansas politicians to accomplish their
purposes. They had earlier thought of removing the Kansas tribes,
one by one, to Indian Territory; but the tribes already there had a
lien upon the land, titles, and other rights, that could not be
ignored. Their possession was to continue so long as the grass
should grow and the water should run. It was not for the government
to say that they should open their doors to anybody. An early
intimation that the Kansans saw their opportunity was a
resolution<a id="footnotetag626" name="footnotetag626"></a><a href=

Senate, March 17, 1862, proposing an inquiry into "the propriety
and expediency of extending the southern boundary of Kansas to the
northern boundary of Texas, so as to include within the boundaries
of Kansas the territory known as the Indian territory." Obviously,
the proposition had a military object immediately in view; but

<p>Behind Pomeroy's suggestion was the spirit of retaliation, of
meting out punishment to the Indians, who, because they had been so
basely deserted by the United States government, had gone over to
the Confederacy; but the Kansas politicians saw a chance to kill
two birds with one stone, vindictively punish the southern Indians
for their defection and rid Kansas of the northern Indians, both
emigrant and indigenous. The intruders upon Indian lands, the
speculators and the politicians, would get the spoils of victory.
Against the idea of punishing the southern Indians for what after
all was far from being entirely their fault, the friends of justice
marshaled their forces. Dole was not exactly of their number; for
he had other ends to serve in resisting measures advanced by the
Kansans, yet, to his credit be it said that he did always hold
firmly to the notion that tribes like the Cherokee were more sinned
against than sinning. The government had been the first to shirk
responsibility and to violate sacred obligations. It had failed to
give the protection guaranteed by treaties and it was not giving it
yet adequately.</p>

to exchange their present homes for homes in Indian Territory. Some
had already discussed the matter tentatively and on their own

repudiated their alliance with the southern Confederacy. That the
United States government was only awaiting a time most propitious
for itself is evident from the fact that, when, in the spring
following, refugees from the Neutral Lands were given an
opportunity to begin their backward trek, they were told that they

usual appraisement of the white man's dealings. A rough draft of
another treaty seems to have been sent to Agent Abbott for the
Shawnees on July 18 and another, substantially the same, December
29. One of the matters that called for adjustment was the Shawnee
contract with the Methodist Episcopal Church South, Dole affirming
that "as the principal members of that corporation, and those who
control it are now in rebellion against the U.S. Government, the
said contract is to be regarded as terminated...." [Indian Office
Land Files, <i>Shawnee</i>, 1860-1865, I 865]. Usher's letter to
Dole of December 27, 1862 was the basis of the instruction. Dole's
negotiations of 1863 were impeached as were all the previous, Black
Bob and Paschal Fish, the first and second chiefs of the
Chillicothe Band of Shawnees, leading the opposition. Agent Abbott
was charged with using questionable means for obtaining Indian
approval [<i>ibid</i>., General Files, <i>Shawnee</i>, 1863-1875].
Conditions at the Shawnee Agency had been in a bad state for a long
time, since before the war. Guerrilla attacks and threatened
attacks had greatly disturbed domestic politics. They had
interfered with the regular tribal elections.</p>
<p>"Last fall (1862), owing to the constant disturbance on the
border of Mo., the election was postponed from time to time, until
the 12th of January. Olathe had been sacked, Shawnee had been
burned, and the members of the Black Bob settlement had been robbed
and driven from their homes, and it had not been considered safe
for any considerable number to congregate together from the fact
that the Shawnees usually all come on horseback, and the
bushwhackers having ample means to know what was going on, would
take the opportunity to make a dash among them, and secure their
horses.</p>

being some twenty miles from the border ..."&mdash;Abbott to Dole,

new home. Their confidence in Abbott must have been by that time
somewhat restored, since the prospecting delegation invited him to
join it [<i>ibid., Shawnee</i>, A 755 of 1864]. A chief source of
grievance against him and cause for distrust of him had reference
to certain depredation claims of the Shawnees [<i>ibid</i>.,

amply describe the affair:</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>"I have just returned to this place from the Grand Council of
the Great and Little Osage Indians. I found them feeling decidedly
fine over their recent success in destroying a band of nineteen
rebels attempting to pass through their country. A band of the
Little Osages met them first and demanded their arms and that they
should go with them to Humboldt (as we instructed them to do at the
Council at Belmont). The rebels refused and shot one of the Osages
dead. The Osages then fired on them. They ran and a running fight
was kept up for some 15 miles. The rebel guide was killed early in
the action. After crossing Lightning Creek, the rebels turned up
the creek toward the camp of the Big Hill Camp. The Little Osages
had sent a runner to aprise the Big Hills of the presence of the
rebels and they were coming down the creek 400 strong, and met the
rebels, drove them to the creek and surrounded them. The rebels
displayed a white flag but the Indians disregarded it. They killed
all of them as they supposed; but afterwards learned that two of
them, badly wounded, got down a steep bank of the creek and made
their escape down the creek. They scalped them all and cut their
heads off. They killed 4 of their horses (which the Indians greatly
regretted) and captured 13, about 50 revolvers, most of the rebels
having 4 revolvers, a carbine and saber. There were 3 colonels, one
lieutenant-colonel, one major and 4 captains. They had full
authority to organise enroll and muster into rebel service all the
rebels in Colorado and New Mexico where they were doubtless bound.
Major Dowdney [Doudna] in command of troops at Humboldt went down
with a detachment and buried them and secured the papers, letting
the Indians keep all the horses, arms, etc. I have no doubt that
this will afford more protection to the frontiers of Kansas than
anything that has yet been done and from the frequency and boldness
of the raids recently something of the kind was very much needed.
The Indians are very much elated over it. I gave them all the
encouragement I could, distributed between two and three hundred

<h2>XI. INDIAN TERRITORY IN 1863, JANUARY TO JUNE INCLUSIVE</h2>
<p>As with the war as a whole, so with that part of it waged on the
Arkansas frontier, the year 1863 proved critical. Its midsummer
season saw the turning-point in the respective fortunes of the
North and the South, both in the east and in the west. The
beginning of 1863 was a time for recording great depletion of
resources in Indian Territory, as elsewhere, great disorganization
within Southern Indian ranks, and much privation, suffering, and
resultant dissatisfaction among the tribes generally. The moment
called for more or less sweeping changes in western commands. Those
most nearly affecting the Arkansas frontier were the establishment
of Indian Territory as a separate military entity<a id=
"footnotetag692" name="footnotetag692"></a><a href=
"#footnote692"><sup>692</sup></a> and the detachment of western
Louisiana</p>
<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote692" name=
"footnote692"></a><b>Footnote 692:</b> <a href=
"#footnotetag692">(return)</a>
<p>The establishment of a separate command for Indian Territory was
not accomplished all at once. In December, 1862, Steele had been
ordered to report to Holmes for duty and, in the first week of
January, he was given the Indian Territory post, subject to
Hindman. On or about the eighth, he assumed command [<i>Official
Records</i>, vol. xxii, part i, 28] at Fort Smith. In less than a
week thereafter, his command was separated from that of Hindman
[<i>ibid</i>., part ii, 771]. The following document shows exactly
what had been the previous relation between the two:</p>
<p>Head Qrs. Dept. Indn. Terry.<br />
Ft. Smith, Jan. 31st, 1863.</p>
<p>COLONEL: Your special No. 22, par. viii has been recd. I would
respectfully suggest that when assigned to this command by Maj.
Gen'l Hindman the command was styled in orders, "1st Div'n 1st
Corps Trans. Miss. Army." The special order referred to, it is
respectfully suggested, may be susceptible of misconstruction as
there are under my command two separate Brigades, one under the
command (cont.)</p>

<p>and Texas from the Trans-Mississippi Department.<a id=
"footnotetag693" name="footnotetag693"></a><a href=
"#footnote693"><sup>693</sup></a> Both were accomplished in January
and both were directly due to a somewhat tardy realization of the
vast strategic importance of the Indian country. Unwieldy,
geographically, the Trans-Mississippi Department had long since
shown itself to be. Moreover, it was no longer even passably safe
to leave the interests of Indian Territory subordinated to those of
Arkansas.<a id="footnotetag694" name="footnotetag694"></a><a href=

the command of Indian Territory was William Steele,
brigadier-general, northern born, of southern sympathies. Thus was
ignored whatever claim Douglas H. Cooper might have been thought to
have by reason of his intimate and long acquaintance with Indian
affairs and his influence, surpassingly great, with certain of the
tribes. Cooper's unfortunate weakness, addiction to intemperance,
had stood more or less in the way of his promotion right along just
as it had decreased his military efficiency on at least one
memorable occasion and had hindered the confirmation of his
appointment as superintendent of Indian affairs in the Arkansas and
Red River constituency. In this narrative, as events are divulged,
it will be seen that the preference for Steele exasperated Cooper,
who was not a big enough man to put love of country before the
gratification of his own</p>

Indians, outside of the ranks, were tragic figures in their utter

<p>The winter of 1862-1863 was a severe one. Its coming had been
long deferred; but, by the middle of January, the cold weather had
set in in real earnest. Sleet and snow and a constantly descending
thermometer made campaigning quite out of the question. Colonel
Phillips, no more than did his adversary, General Steele, gave any
thought to an immediate offensive. Like Steele his one idea was to
replenish resources and to secure an outfit for his men. They had
been provided with the half worn-out baggage train of Blunt's old
division. It was their all and would be so until their commander
could supplement it by contrivances and careful management.
Incidentally, Phillips expected to hold the line of the Arkansas
River; but not to attempt to cross it until spring should come. It
behooved him to look out for Marmaduke whose expeditions into
Missouri<a id="footnotetag719" name="footnotetag719"></a><a href=

<p>The second regiment, after many vicissitudes, and after having
gotten rid of its unmanageable elements, notably, the Osages and
the Quapaws, had become a Cherokee and the third was largely so.
That third regiment was Phillips's own and was the only one that
could claim the distinction of being disciplined and even it was
exposed occasionally to the chronic weakness of all Indian
soldiers, absence without leave. The Indian, on his own business
bent, was disposed to depart whenever he pleased, often, too, at
times most inopportune, sometimes, when he had been given a special
and particular task. He knew not the usages of army life and really
meant no offence; but, all the same, his utter disregard of army
discipline made for great disorder.</p>
<p>It was not the chief cause of disorder, however, for that was
the unreliability of the regimental officers. The custom, from the
first, had been to have the field officers white men, a saving
grace; but the company officers, with few exceptions, had been
Indians and totally incompetent. Strange as it may seem, drilling
was almost an unknown experience to the two regiments that had been
mustered in for the First Indian Expedition. To obviate some of the
difficulties already encountered, Phillips had seen to it that the
third regiment had profited by the mistakes of its forerunners. It
had, therefore, been supplied with white first lieutenants and
white sergeants, secured from among the non-commissioned men of
other commands. The result had fully justified the innovation.
After long and careful observation, Phillips's conclusion was that
it was likely to be productive of irretrievable disaster and
consequently an unpardonable error of judgment "to put men of poor
ability in an Indian regiment." Primitive man has an inordinate
respect for a strong</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg
253]</span>
<p>character. He appreciates integrity, though he may not have it
among his own gifts of nature. "An Indian company improperly
officered" will inevitably become, to somebody's discomfiture, "a
frightful mess."</p>
<p>If any one there was so foolish as to surmise that the
independent commands, northern and southern, would be given free
scope to solve the problems of Indian Territory, unhampered by
contingent circumstances, he was foreordained to grevious
disappointment. Indian Territory had still to subserve the
interests of localities, relatively more important. It would be so
to the very end. In and for herself, she would never be allowed to
do anything and her commanders, no matter how much they might wish
it otherwise&mdash;and to their lasting honor, be it said, many of
them did&mdash;would always have to subordinate her affairs to
those of the sovereign states around her; for even northern states
were sovereign in practice where Indians were concerned. General
Steele was one of the men who endeavored nobly to take a large view
of his responsibilities to Indian Territory. Colonel Phillips, his
contemporary in the opposite camp, was another; but both met with
insuperable obstacles. The attainment of their objects was
impossible from the start. Both men were predestined to
failure.</p>
<p>Foraging or an occasional scouting when the weather permitted
was the only order of the winter days for Federals and
Confederates. With the advent of spring, however, Phillips became
impatient for more aggressive action. He had been given a large
programme, no insignificant part of which was, the restoration of
refugees to their impoverished homes; but his first business would
necessarily have to be, the occupancy of the country. Not far was
he allowed to venture within</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg
254]</span>
<p>it during the winter; because his superior officers wished him
to protect, before anything else, western Arkansas. Schofield and,
after Schofield's withdrawal from the command of southwestern
Missouri, Curtis had insisted upon that, while Blunt, to whom
Phillips, after a time, was made immediately accountable, was
guardedly of another way of thinking and, although not very
explicit, seemed to encourage Phillips in planning an advance.</p>
<p>Phillips's inability to progress far in the matter of occupancy
of Indian Territory did not preclude his keeping a close tab on
Indian affairs therein, such a tab, in fact, as amounted to
fomenting an intrigue. It will be recalled that on the occasion of
his making the excursion into the Cherokee Nation, which had
resulted in his incendiary destruction of Fort Davis, he had gained
intimations of a rather wide-spread Indian willingness to desert
the Confederate service. He had sounded Creeks and Choctaws and had
found them surprisingly responsive to his machinations. They were
nothing loath to confess that they were thoroughly disgusted with
the southern alliance. It had netted them nothing but unutterable
woe. Among those that Phillips approached, although not personally,
was Colonel McIntosh, who communicated with Phillips through two
intimate friends. McIntosh was persuaded to attempt no immediate
demonstration in favor of the North; for that would be premature,
foolhardy; but to bide the time, which could not be far distant,
when the Federal troops would be in a position to support
him.<a id="footnotetag721" name="footnotetag721"></a><a href=

It tried his patience sorely; for he felt the crying need of Indian

tacitly sanctioned his advance. Never at any time could there have
been the slightest doubt as to the singleness of the virile
Scotchman's purpose. In imagination he saw his adopted country
repossessed of Indian Territory and of all the overland approaches
to Texas and Mexico from whence, as he supposed, the Confederacy
expected to draw her grain and other supplies. Some regard for the
Indian himself he doubtless had; but he used it as a means to the
greater end. His sense of justice was truly British in its
keenness.</p>

<p>His Indian soldiers loved him. They believed in him. He was able
to accomplish wonders in training them. He looked after their
welfare and he did his best to make the government and its agents
of the Indian Office keep faith with the refugees. Quite
strenuously, too, he advocated further enlistments from among the
Indians, especially from among those yet in Indian Territory. If
the United States did not take care, the Confederates would
successfully conscript where the Federals might easily recruit. In
this matter as in many another, he had Blunt's unwavering support;
for Blunt wanted the officers of the embryo fourth and fifth
regiments to secure their commands. Blunt's military district was
none too full of men.</p>
<p>March was then as now the planting season in the Arkansas Valley
and, as Phillips rightly argued, if the indigent Indians were not
to be completely pauperized, they ought to be given an opportunity
to be thrown once more upon their own resources, to be returned
home in time to put in crops. When the high waters subsided and the
rivers became fordable, he grew more insistent. There was grass in
the valley of the Arkansas and soon the Confederates would be
seizing the stock that it was supporting. He had held the line of
the Arkansas by means of scouts all winter, but scouting would not
be adequate much longer. The Confederates were beginning, in
imitation of the Federals, to attach indigents to their cause by
means of relief distribution and the "cropping season was wearing
on."</p>
<p>At the end of March, some rather unimportant changes were made
by Curtis in the district limits of his department and coincidently
Phillips moved over the border. The first of April his camp was at
Park Hill. His great desire was to seize Fort Smith; for he</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg
259]</span>
<p>realized that not much recruiting could be done among the
Choctaws while that post remained in Confederate hands. Blunt
advised caution. It would not even do to attempt as yet any
permanent occupation south of the Arkansas. Dashes at the enemy
might be made, of course, but nothing more; for at any moment those
higher up might order a retrograde movement and anyhow no
additional support could be counted upon. Halleck was still calling
for men to go to Grant's assistance and accusing Curtis of keeping
too many needlessly in the West. The Vicksburg campaign was on.</p>
<p>The order that Blunt anticipated finally came and Curtis called
for Phillips to return. La Rue Harrison, foraging in
Arkansas,<a id="footnotetag732" name="footnotetag732"></a><a href=
"#footnote732"><sup>732</sup></a> was whining for assistance.
Phillips temporized, having no intention whatsoever of abandoning
his appointed goal. His arguments were unanswerable but Curtis like
Halleck could never be made to appreciate the plighted faith that
lay back of Indian participation in the war and the strategic
importance of Indian Territory. The northern Indian regiments,
pleaded Phillips, were never intended for use in Arkansas. Why
should they go there? It was doubtful if they could ever be induced
to go there again. They had been recruited to recover the Indian
Territory and now that they were within it they were going to stay
until the object had been attained. Phillips solicited Blunt's
backing and got it, to the extent, indeed, that Blunt informed
Curtis that if he wanted Indian Territory given up he must order it
himself and take the consequences. It was not given up but Phillips
suffered great embarrassments in holding it. The only support Blunt
could render him was to send a negro regiment to Baxter Springs to
protect supply</p>

broke out and, as the men became more and more emaciated, gained
ground. Phillips continued to make occasional dashes at the enemy
and in a few engagements he was more than reasonably successful.
Webber's Falls was a case in point.</p>
<p>As May advanced, the political situation in Missouri seemed to
call loudly for a change in department commanders and President
Lincoln, quite on his own initiative apparently, selected Schofield
to succeed Curtis,<a id="footnotetag734" name=

Curtis having identified himself with a faction opposed to Governor
Gamble. The selection was obnoxious to many and to none more than
to Herron and to Blunt, whose military exploits Schofield had
belittled. The former threatened resignation if Schofield were
appointed but the latter restrained himself and for a brief space
all went well, Schofield even manifesting some sympathy for
Phillips at Fort Gibson, or Fort Blunt, as the post, newly
fortified, was now called. He declared that the Arkansas River must
be secured its entire length; but the Vicksburg campaign was still
demanding men and Phillips had to struggle on, unaided. Indeed, he
was finally told that if he could not hold on by himself he must
fall back and let the Indian Territory take care of itself until
Vicksburg should have fallen.</p>

be supplied from this place. Boats w'd be sent farther up the
river, were we otherwise circumstanced. As it is the Boats have

appreciate the difficulties under which Gen. Steele necessarily
labors. In fact his action is completely paralized by the want of

<p>Crosby to Walker, March 11, 1863, <i>ibid</i>., p. 136. Steele
thought that the Indians might as well be employed in a military
way since they were more than likely to be a public charge. To
Colonel Anderson he wrote, March 22, 1863 [<i>ibid</i>., p. 155],
"I forward the above copy of a letter from Gen'l Cooper for Gen'l
Holmes' information. I purpose if not otherwise directed to call
out all the available force of the Nations within the conscript
age.... They have to be fed and might as well be organized and put
into a position to be useful." From the correspondence of Steele,
it would seem that there was some trouble over Walker's promotion.
April 10, Steele wrote again to Anderson on the subject of Indian
enrollment in the ranks and referred to the other matter.</p>
<p>"The enclosed copy of some articles in the Treaty between the
C.S. Govt and the Choctaws with remarks by Gen'l Cooper are
submitted for the consideration of the Lt. Gen'l.</p>
<p>"It appears that Col. Walker was recommended to fill the vacancy
made by the promotion of Col. Cooper, the right being given by the
treaty to appoint to the office of Col., the other offices being
filled by election, and that at the time, the enemy were at Van
Buren. Col. Walker being at the convenient point was put upon duty
by Col. Cooper and has since been recognized by several acts of my
own, not however with a full knowledge of the circumstances. That
under instructions from Gen'l Hindman a Regt was being organized

of which appears to be a very good arrangement. The necessity that

<p>Steele thought it desirable to arrest all men, at large, who
were subject to military duty under the conscript act, unless they
could produce evidence "of a right to remain off duty" [Crosby to
Colonel Newton, January 12, 1863, <i>ibid</i>., p. 32]. Presumably
whole companies were deserting their posts [Crosby to Cooper,
February 1, 1863, <i>ibid</i>., pp. 66-67]. It was suggested that
some deserters should be permitted to organize against jayhawkers
as, under sanction from Holmes, had been the case with deserters in
the Magazine Mountains [Steele to Anderson, February 1, 1863,
<i>ibid</i>., p. 67]. When word came that the Federals were about
to organize militia in northwestern Arkansas, Steele ordered that
all persons, subject to military duty, who should fail to enroll
themselves before February 6, should be treated as bushwhackers
[same to same, February 3, 1863, <i>ibid</i>., pp. 69-70]. Colonel
Charles DeMorse, whose Texas regiment had been ordered, February
15, to report to Cooper [Crosby to DeMorse, February 15, 1863,
<i>ibid</i>.,], asked to be allowed to make an expedition against
the wild tribes. Some two hundred fifty citizens would be more than
glad to accompany it. Steele was indignant and Duval, at his
direction, wrote thus to Cooper, April 19: "... Now if these men
were so anxious to march three or four hundred miles to <i>find</i>
the enemy, they could certainly be induced to take up arms
<i>temporarily</i> in defence of their immediate homes"
[<i>ibid</i>., p. 203]. It was not that Steele objected to
expeditions against the wild tribes but he was disgusted with the
lack of patriotism and military enthusiasm among the Texans and
Arkansans. Colonel W.P. Lane's regiment of Texas Partizan Rangers
was another that had to be chided for its dilatoriness
[<i>ibid</i>., pp. 168-169, 199, 234]. Deficient means of
transportation was oftentimes the excuse given for failure to
appear but Steele's complaint to Anderson, April 10 [<i>ibid</i>.,
185-186], was very much more to the point. He wrote,</p>
<p>"... I find that men are kept back upon every pretext; that
QrMasters and Govt Agents or persons calling themselves such have
detailed them to drive teams hauling cotton to Mexico, and employed
them about the Gov't agencies. This cotton speculating mania is
thus doing us great injury besides taking away all the
transportation in the country...." Public feeling in Texas was on
the side of deserters to a very great extent and in one instance,
at least, Steele was forced to defer to it, "You will desist from
the attempt to take the deserters from Hart's Company or any other
in northern Texas if the state of public feeling is such that it
cannot be done without (cont.)</p>

<p>Holmes, as early as March, warned Steele that he would have to
get his supplies soon from Texas. It would not be possible to draw
them much longer from the Arkansas River. He was told to prepare to
get them in Texas "at all hazard," which instruction was construed
by Steele to mean, "take it, if you cant buy it" [<i>ibid</i>.,
145-146]. It was probably the prospect of having to use force or
compulsion that made Steele so interested, late in May, in finding
out definitely whether Hindman's acts in Arkansas had really been
legalized [Steele to Blair, May 22, 1863, <i>ibid</i>., 34].
Appreciating that it was matter of vital concern that the grain
crop in northern Texas should be harvested, Steele was at a loss to
know how to deal with petitions that solicited furloughs for the

to Cabell, May 7, 1863, <i>ibid</i>., 230-231]. Perhaps, it was a

disaffection:</p>
<p>DEAR GREAT FATHER: Sir, The wicked rebellion in the United
States has caused a division in the Nation. Some of our many loving
leaders have joined the rebels merely for speculation and
consequently divided our people and that brought ruin in our
Nation. They had help near and ours was far so that our ruin was
sure. We saw this plain beforehand. Therefore we concluded to go to
you our great father, remembering the treaty that you have made
with us long ago in which you promised us protection. This was the
cause that made us to go and meet you in your white house about
eighteen months ago and there laid our complaint before you, as a
weaker brother wronged of his rights by a stronger brother and you
promised us your protection; but before we got back to our people

most every thing they had was taken away from them ... Now this was
the way we left our country and this was the condition of our

<p>Certain proceedings of Carruth and Martin would seem to suggest
that they were endeavoring to reap the reward of Phillips's labors,
by negotiating, somewhat prematurely, for an inter-tribal council.
Coffin may have endorsed it, but Dole had not [Dole to Coffin, July
8, 1863, Indian Office <i>Letter Book</i>, no. 71, p. 116]. The
pretext for calling such a council lay in fairly recent doings of
the wild tribes. The subjoined letters and extracts of letters will
elucidate the subject: February 7, Coffin reported to Dole [General
Files, <i>Southern Superintendency</i>, 1863-1864] that the wild
Indians had been raiding on the Verdigris and Fall Rivers into the
Creek and Cherokee countries, "jayhawking property," and bringing
it into Kansas and selling it to the settlers. Some of the cattle
obtained in this way had been (cont.)</p>

terrible mistake, a miscalculation beyond all remedying.</p>

and of regret had a different meaning. The</p>

Indians. Jim Ned's band of wild Delawares, returning from such a
jayhawking expedition, had stolen some Osage ponies and had become
involved in a fight in which two Delawares had been killed [Coffin
to Dole, February 12, 1863, <i>ibid., Neosho</i>, C 73 of 1863].
Coffin prevailed upon Jim Ned to stop the jayhawking excursions;
inasmuch as "Considerable bad feeling exists on the part of the
Cherokees in consequence of the bringing up ... a great many
cattle, ponies, and mules, which they allege belong to the Cherokee
refugees ..." [Coffin to Dole, February 24, 1863, Indian Office
General Files, <i>Southern Superintendency</i>, 1863-1864].</p>

the emissaries of the Rebellion in fomenting discords and warlike
raids upon whites as well as Indians ..." [Coffin to Dole, June 25,
1863, <i>ibid</i>., C 325]. It was under such circumstances that
Carruth took it upon himself to arrange an inter-tribal council.
This is his report [Carruth to Coffin, June 17, 1863,
<i>ibid</i>.,]. His action was seconded by Martin [Martin to
Coffin, June 18, 1863, <i>ibid</i>.,]:</p>
<p>"I left Belmont (the temporary Wichita agency) May 26th to hold
a Council with the Indians of the Wichita Agency, who have not as

Sacs, and here I was informed by the Kickapoos, that no runner had
gone through to the Cadoes and Comanches from them, as we had heard
at Belmont, yet I learned, that these tribes were then camped at

emphasis upon that part of it that recounted delusion and betrayal.
For quite a while now the Indians had been feeling themselves
neglected. Steele was aware of the fact but helpless. When told of
treaty rights he had to plead ignorance; for he had never seen the
treaties and had no official knowledge of their contents. He was
exercising the functions of superintendent <i>ex officio</i>, not
because the post had ever been specifically conferred upon him or
instructions sent, but because he had come to his command to find
it, in nearly every aspect, Indian and no agent or superintendent
at hand to take charge <a id="footnotetag785" name=

mouth of the Little Arkansas River within six weeks. Meanwhile they
are to send runners to notify these tribes to gather on the
Arkansas, sixty miles above, that they may be within reach of our
call when we get to the Council ground. Subsistence will have to be
provided for at least 10000 Indians at that time. They will expect
something from the Government to convince them of its power to
carry through its promises. Some of the Cadoes and Comanches
connected with this Agency, after coming to the Arkansas, returned
to Fort Cobb. These will all come back to this Council. Their
desire is to be subsisted on the Little Arkansas, some 70 miles
from Emporia until the war closes.</p>
<p>"They argue like this, 'The Government once sent us our
provisions to Fort Cobb over 300 miles from Fort Smith. We do not
want to live near the whites, because of troubles between them and
us in regard to ponies, timber, fields, green corn, etc. Our
subsistence can be hauled to the mouth of the Little Arkansas,
easier by far, than it was formerly from Fort Smith, and by being
at this point we shall be removed from the abodes of the whites, so
they cannot steal our ponies, nor can our people trouble them.'</p>
<p>"I believe they are right. I have had more trouble the past
winter in settling difficulties between the Indians and whites on
account of trades, stolen horses, broken fences, etc. than from all
other causes combined.</p>
<p>"I cannot get all the Indians of this Agency together this side
of the Little Arkansas. That point will be near enough the Texan
frontier for the Indians to go home easily when the war closes. It
is on the direct route to Fort Cobb. They are opposed to going via
Fort Gibson ..."</p>

<p>ordinarily not strictly within the range of military
cognizance.</p>
<p>General Steele, like many another, was inclined to think that
the red men greatly over-estimated their own importance; for they
failed to "see and understand how small a portion of the
field"<a id="footnotetag786" name="footnotetag786"></a><a href=
"#footnote786"><sup>786</sup></a> they really occupied. To Steele,
it was not Indian Territory that was valuable but Texas. For him
the Indian country, barren by reason of the drouth, denuded of its
live stock, a prey to jayhawker, famine, and pestilence, did
nothing more than measure the distance between the Federals and the
rich Texan grain-fields, from whence he fondly hoped an

a mere buffer.</p>
<p>But it was a buffer, throbbing with life, and that was something
Steele dared not ignore and could not if he would. With such a
consciousness, when the secessionist Cherokees were making
arrangements for their council at Webber's Falls in April, he
hastened to propitiate them ahead of time by addressing them

thing to assist in helping their own people who are destitute. I
have, in many instances, been unable to get wagons to haul the
flour given them. I have incurred a great responsibility in using
army rations in this way and to the extent that I have. I have
endeavored to give to all destitute and to sell at cost to those
who are able to purchase. In this matter the Nation has been more
favored than the adjacent States. I am told by Mr. Boudinot that a
bill was passed by the Cherokee Council, taking the matter into
their own hands. I hope it is so. In which case I shall cease
issuing to others who have not, like them, been driven from their

<p>be in the matter of attention to Indian necessities, his efforts
were unappreciated largely because of evil influences at work to
undermine him and to advance Douglas H. Cooper. Steele had his
points of vulnerability, his inability to check the Federal advance
and his remoteness from the scene of action, his headquarters being
at Fort Smith. Connected with the second point and charged against
him were all the bad practices of those men who, in their political
or military control of Indian Territory, had allowed Arkansas to be
their chief concern. Such practices became the foundation stone of
a general Indian dissatisfaction and, concomitantry, Douglas H.
Cooper, of insatiable ambition, posed as the exponent of the idea
that the safety of Indian Territory was an end in itself.</p>
<p>The kind of separate military organization that constituted
Steele's command was not enough for the Indians. Seemingly, they
desired the restoration of the old Pike department, but not such as
it had been in the days of the controversy with Hindman but such as
it always was in Pike's imagination. The Creeks were among the

<p>be allowed to settle, on equal terms with the Cherokees, within
the Cherokee country. The proposal, as construed by Taylor and his
party, was nothing more or less than a suggestion that the
Cherokees surrender their nationality, their political integrity,
the one thing above everything else that they had sought to
preserve when they entered into an active alliance with the
Confederate States. So sordid was the bargain proposed, so unequal,
that the thought obtrudes itself that a base advantage was about to
be taken of the Cherokee necessities and that the objectors were
justified in insinuating that Boudinot and his political friends
were to be the chief beneficiaries. The Cherokee country was
already practically lost to the Confederacy. Might it not be
advisable to distribute the tribal lands, secure individual
holdings, while vested rights might still accrue; for, should bad
come to worse, private parties could with more chance of success
prosecute a claim than could a commonalty, which in its national or
corporate capacity had committed treason and thereby forfeited its
rights. One part of the Cherokee protest merits quotation here. Its
noble indignation ought to have been proof enough for anybody.</p>

<h2>XII. INDIAN TERRITORY IN 1863, JULY TO DECEMBER INCLUSIVE</h2>
<p>Independence Day, 1863, witnessed climacteric scenes in the war
dramas, east and west. The Federal victories of Gettysburg and
Vicksburg, all-decisive in the history of the great American
conflict, when considered in its entirety, had each its measure of
immediate and local importance. The loss of all control of the
Mississippi navigation meant for the Confederacy its practical
splitting in twain and the isolation of its western part. For the
Arkansas frontier and for the Missouri border generally, it
promised, since western commands would now recover their men and
resume their normal size, increased Federal aggressiveness or the
end of suspended. Initial preparation for such renewed
aggressiveness was contemporary with the fall of Vicksburg and lay
in the failure of the Confederate attack upon Helena, an attack
that had been projected for the making of a diversion only. The
failure compelled Holmes to draw his forces back to Little
Rock.</p>
<p>Confederate operations in Indian Territory through May and June
had been, as already described, confined to sporadic demonstrations
against Federal herds and Federal supply trains, all having for
their main object the dislodgment of Phillips from Fort Gibson.
What proved to be their culmination and the demonstration most
energetically conducted occurred at Cabin Creek,<a id=

<p>Gettysburg was being fought. A commissary train from Fort Scott
was expected. It was to come down, escorted by Colonel Williams who
was in command of the negro troops that Blunt had stationed at
Baxter Springs. To meet the train and to reinforce Williams,
Phillips despatched Major Foreman from Fort Gibson. Cooper had

it in a fashion now customary.<a id="footnotetag798" name=

<p>Of W.L. Cabell, the <i>Confederate Military History</i>, vol. x,
has this to say: "Maj. W.L. Cabell, who had been sent to inspect
the accounts of quartermasters in the department, having well
acquitted himself of this duty, was, in March 1863, commissioned
brigadier-general and requested to collect absentees from the
service in northwestern Arkansas. Given Carroll's and Monroe's
regiments, he was directed to perfect such organizations as he
could ..." He collected his brigade with great rapidity and it soon
numbered about four thousand men. Even, in April, Steele was
placing much reliance upon it, although he wished to keep its
relation to him a secret. He wrote to Cooper to that effect.</p>
<p>"Who will be in command of the Choctaws when you leave? Will
they be sufficient to picket and scout on the other side of the
river far enough to give notice of any advance of the enemy down
the river? I do not wish it to be generally known that Cabell's
forces are under my command, but prefer the enemy should think them
a separate command; for this reason I do not send these troops west
until there is a necessity for it; in the meantime the other troops
can be brought into position, where if we can get sufficient
ammunition all can be concentrated. I cannot direct positively, not
having the intimate knowledge of the country, but you should be in
a position which would enable you to move either down the Ark.
River or on to the road leading from Boggy Depot to Gibson as
circumstances may indicate. Let me hear from you
frequently."&mdash;STEELE to Cooper, April 28, 1863, <i>Confederate
Records</i>, chap. 2, no. 270, pp. 217-218.</p>

<p>part of his own brigade and at the same time ordered another
part under Stand Watie to go to Cabin Creek and to take such
position on its south bank as to command the crossing. It was a
time when the rivers were all in flood, a circumstance that greatly
affected the outcome since it prevented the forces on the east side
of the Grand from coming to Stand Watie's support. As Foreman
proceeded northward to effect a junction with Williams, he detached
some Cherokees from the Third Indian, under Lieutenant Luke F.
Parsons, to reconnoitre. In that way he became apprised of Watie's
whereabouts and enabled to put himself on his guard. The commissary
train, in due time, reached Cabin Creek and, after some slight
delay caused, not by Stand Watie's interposition, but by the high
waters, crossed. Federals and Confederates then collided in a
somewhat disjointed but lengthy engagement with the result that
Stand Watie retired and the train, nothing the worse for the
hold-up, moved on without further molestation to Fort Gibson.<a id=

<p>The action at Cabin Creek, July 1 to 3, was the last attempt of
any size for the time being to capture Federal supplies en route.
The tables were thenceforth turned and the Confederates compelled
to keep a close</p>

<p>In describing what appears to be the action at Cabin Creek,
Steele refers to "bad conduct of the Creeks," and holds it partly
responsible for the failure [<i>Official Records</i>, vol. xxii,
part ii, 910]. It is possible that he had in mind, however, a
slightly earlier encounter, the same that he described, adversely
to D.N. McIntosh's abilities as a commander, in his general report
[<i>ibid</i>., part i, 32]. Steele had little faith in the Indian
brigade and frankly admitted that he expected it in large measure,
to "dissolve," if the Confederates were to be forced to fall back
at Cabin Creek [Steele to Blair, July 1, 1863, <i>Official
Records</i>, vol. xxii, part ii, 902]. Nevertheless, he anticipated
a victory for his arms there [Steele to Blair, July 3, 1863,
<i>ibid</i>., 903]. From his general report, it might be thought
that Stand Watie disappointed him at this time, as later; but the
Confederate failure was most certainly mainly attributable to the
high waters, which prevented the union of their expeditionary
forces [Steele to Blair, July 5, 1863, <i>ibid</i>., 905].</p>

<p>watch on their own depots and trains. Up to date, since his
first arrival at Fort Gibson, Colonel Phillips had been necessarily
on the defensive because of the fewness of his men. Subsequent to
the Cabin Creek affair came a change, incident to events and
conditions farther east. The eleventh of July brought General
Blunt, commander of the District of the Frontier, to Fort Gibson.
His coming was a surprise, as has already been casually remarked,
but it was most timely. There was no longer any reason whatsoever
why offensive action should not be the main thing on the Federal
docket in Indian Territory, as elsewhere.</p>
<p>To protect its own supplies and to recuperate, the strength of
the Confederate Indian brigade was directed toward Red River,
notwithstanding that Steele had still the hope of dislodging the
Federals north of the Arkansas.<a id="footnotetag802" name=

stronghold Bankhead might move. He might attack Fort Scott, Blunt's
headquarters but greatly weakened now, and possibly also some small
posts in southwest Missouri, replenishing his resources from time
to time in the fertile and well settled Neosho River Valley.

<p>Arkansas betrayed similar selfishness. President Davis's
rejoinder to a protest from Flanagin against a tendency to ignore
the claims of the West struck a singularly high note. Admitting
certain errors of the past, he prayed for the generous
co&ouml;peration of the future; for "it is to the future, not to
the past, that we must address ourselves, and I wish to assure you,
though I hope it is unnecessary, that no effort shall be spared to
promote the defense of the Trans-Mississippi Department, and to
develop its resources so as to meet the exigencies of the present
struggle" [<i>Official Records</i>, vol. xxii, part ii, 932]. Five
days afterwards, Governor Reynolds, in commending Secretary Seddon
for a very able ministry, expressed confidence that his
gubernatorial colleagues in Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana would,
with himself, "act in no sectional or separatist spirit." It was
saying a good deal, considering how strong the drift of popular
opinion had been and was to be in the contrary direction. However,
in August, the four governors appealed collectively to their
constituents and to "the Allied Indian Nations," proving, if proof
were needed, that they personally were sincere [<i>ibid</i>., vol.

<p>In the fortunes of the Southern Indians, the Battle of Honey
Springs was a decisive event. Fought and lost in the country of the
Creeks, it was bound to have upon them a psychological effect
disastrous to the steady maintenance of their alliance with the
Confederacy, so also with the other great tribes; but more of that
anon. In a military way, it was no less significant than in a
political; for it was the beginning of a vigorously offensive
campaign, conducted by General Blunt, that never ended until the
Federals were in occupation of Fort Smith and Fort Smith was at the
very door of the Choctaw country. No Indian tribe, at the outset of
the war, had more completely gone over to the South than had the
Choctaw. It had influenced the others but had already come to rue
the day that had seen its own first defection. Furthermore, the
date of the Confederate rout at Honey Springs marked the beginning
of a period during which dissatisfaction with General Steele
steadily crystallized.</p>
<p>Within six weeks after the Battle of Honey Springs, the Federals
were in possession of Fort Smith, which was not surprising
considering the happenings of the intervening days. The
miscalculations that had eventuated in the routing of Cooper had
brought Steele to the decision of taking the field in person; for
there was just a chance that he might succeed where his
subordinates, with less at stake than he, had failed. Especially
might he take his chances on winning if he could count upon help
from Bankhead to whom he had again made application, nothing
deterred by his previous ill-fortune.</p>

<p>as he had, the mere idea of such an undertaking would be
preposterous. The defensive would have to be, for some time to
come, his leading role; but he did hope to be able to harry his
enemy, somewhat, to entice him away from his fortifications and to
make those fortifications of little worth by cutting off his
supplies. Another commissary train would be coming down from Fort

abandoned; inasmuch as a regiment under Morgan of Cabell's brigade
was left in charge, but it was relinquished as department
headquarters. Steele then took up his march for Cooper's old
battle-ground on Elk Creek. There he planned to mass his forces and
to challenge an attack. He went by way of Prairie Springs<a id=

<p>come to him that Congress had decided to relieve Kansas of her
Indian encumbrance by compassing the removal of all her tribes,
indigenous and immigrant, to Indian Territory. It mattered not that
the former had a title to their present holdings by ancient
occupation and long continued possession and the latter a title in
perpetuity, guaranteed by the treaty-making power under the United
States constitution. All the tribes were to be ousted from the soil
of the state that had been saved to freedom; but it would be first
necessary to secure the Indian Territory and the men of the Kansas
tribes were to be organized as soldiers to secure it. It is
difficult to imagine a more ironical proceeding. The Indians were
to be induced to fight for the recovery of a section of the country
that would make possible their own banishment. Blunt strenuously
objected, not because he was averse to ridding Kansas of the
Indians, but because he had no faith in an Indian soldiery. Said
he,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several reasons why I do not think such a policy
practicable or advisable. It would take several months under the
most favorable circumstances to organize and put into the field the
Indians referred to, even were they ready and willing to enlist, of
which fact I am not advised, but presume they would be very slow to
enlist; besides my experience thus far with Indian soldiers has
convinced me that they are of little service to the Government
compared with other soldiers. The Cherokees, who are far superior
in every respect to the Kansas Indians, did very good service while
they had a specific object in view&mdash;the possession and
occupation of their own country; having accomplished that, they
have become greatly demoralized and nearly worthless as troops. I
would earnestly recommend that (as the best policy the Government
can pursue with these Indian regiments) they be mustered out of
service some time during the coming winter, and put to work raising
their subsistence, with a few white troops stationed among them for
their protection.</p>

retarded his movements a trifle; but on the twenty-second of
August, two days after the massacre by guerrillas had occurred at
Lawrence, he crossed the Arkansas. He was at length accepting
General Steele's challenge but poor Steele was quite unprepared for
a duel of any sort. If Blunt distrusted the Indians, how very much
more did he and with greater reason! With insufficient guns and
ammunition, with no troops, white or red, upon whom he could
confidently rely, and with no certainty of help from any quarter,
he was compelled to adopt a Fabian policy, and he moved slowly
backward, inviting yet never stopping to accept a full and regular
engagement. Out of the Creek country he went and into the
Choctaw.<a id="footnotetag837" name="footnotetag837"></a><a href=

<p>Steele had crossed the line between the Creeks and Choctaws,
however, before Blunt crossed the Arkansas. On August sixteenth, he
had his camp on Longtown Creek and was sending a detachment out as
far south as within about ten miles of Boggy Depot [<i>Official
Records</i>, vol. xxii, part ii, 968]. A few days later, he made
his camp on Brooken Creek, a little to the eastward [<i>ibid</i>.,
972]. By that time, Steele was evidently quite reconciled to the
thought that Fort Smith might at any moment be attacked and,
perhaps, in such force that it would be needless to attempt to
defend it. Cabell was to move to a safe distance, in the
neighborhood of Scullyville, from whence, should there be
reasonable prospect of success, he might send out
re&euml;nforcements. In the event of almost certain failure, he was
to draw off betimes in the direction of Riddle's station, where
flour was stored [<i>ibid</i>.].</p>

tribe and to other tribes. Watie's appeal will be taken up later,

<p>That Smith was no more sincere than other white men had been,
when addressing Indians, goes almost without saying. It was
necessary to pacify Stand Watie and promises would no longer
suffice. Candor was a better means to the end sought. Had Smith
only not so very recently had his interview with the governors of
the southwestern states, his tone might not have been so
conciliatory. In anticipation of that interview and in advance of
it, for it might come too late, some Arkansans, with R.W. Johnson
among them, had impressed it upon Governor Flanagin that both
Arkansas and Indian Territory were necessary to the Confederacy. In
their communication, appeared these fatal admissions, fatal to any
claim of disinterestedness:</p>
<p>"Negro slavery exists in the Indian Territory, and is profitable
and desirable there, affording a practical issue of the right of
expansion, for which the war began..." [July 25, 1863, <i>Official

filling vacancies in the Indian representation came up for
discussion or for reference [See <i>Journal</i>, vols. iii, vi]. It
became law in January, 1864 [<i>ibid</i>., vol. iii, 521]. A

Elias C. Boudinot appeared first on the roll, January 8, 1864; but
it must be erroneous, since Boudinot, as the delegate from the
Cherokee Nation, was very active in Congress all through the year
1863. His colleague from the Choctaw Nation was Robert M. Jones. On
December 10, when Indian affairs had become exceedingly critical,
Representative Hanly moved that one of the Indian delegates should
be requested to attend the sessions of the Committee on Indian
Affairs (<i>Journal</i>, vol. vi, 520). This proposition eventually

<p>Scott entered the Indian Territory in July and was at once beset
with complaints and solicitations, individual and tribal. On his
own account, he made not a few discoveries. On the eighth of August
he reported<a id="footnotetag854" name=

Holmes upon things that have already been considered here,

did he say about the Cooper<a id="footnotetag855" name=
"footnotetag855"></a><a href="#footnote855"><sup>855</sup></a> and
Boudinot intrigues. It was too early to commit himself on matters
so personal and yet so fundamental. The Indians were not so
reticent. The evil influence that Cooper had over them, due largely
to the fact that he professed himself to be interested in Indian
Territory to the exclusion of all other parts of the country, was
beginning to find expression in various communications to President
Davis and others in authority. Just how far Stand Watie was privy
to Cooper's schemes and in sympathy with them, it is impossible to
say. Boudinot was Cooper's able coadjutor, fellow conspirator,
while Boudinot and Watie were relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Watie's energies, especially his intellectual, were apparently
being exerted in directions far removed from the realm of selfish
and petty intrigue. He was a man of vision, of deep penetration
likewise, and he was a patriot. Personal ambition was not his
besetting sin. If he had only had real military ability and the
qualities that make for discipline and for genuine leadership</p>

reports<a id="footnotetag856" name="footnotetag856"></a><a href=

nothing less than to dispel despondency and to arouse to
action.</p>
<p>Watie's appeal may have had the effect designed but it was an

within the limits of the command or to keep in touch with him.
Cooper was displaying great activity, was making plans to recover

Fort Scott to that place that the massacre of Baxter Springs

projected in a spirit of bravado, deviltry, and downright savagery,
and had undoubtedly been incited by the execution of Ewing's
notorious order, <i>Number Eleven</i> [<i>Official Records</i>,
vol. xxii, part ii, 473]. That order, as modified by Schofield, had
authorized the depopulating of those counties of Missouri, Jackson,
Cass, Bates, and a part of Vernon, where the guerrillas were
believed to have their chief recruiting stations and where
secessionist feeling had always been dominant. It was at once
retaliatory and precautionary and on a par with the instructions
for the removal of the Acadians on the eve of the breaking out of
the French and Indian War. The banished Missourians have, however,

<p>frequently was this the case in the matter of transportation

that the impressment law and the grain tithe law were not operative
as against the Indians<a id="footnotetag885" name=
"footnotetag885"></a><a href="#footnote885"><sup>885</sup></a> but
his necessities forced the practice, and execution by the army,

<p>Indian opposition to Steele in tangible form took two
directions, one of which, the advancement of Douglas H. Cooper, has
already been frequently referred to. The other was the advancement
of Stand Watie. During the summer, Stand Watie, as chief of the
Confederate Cherokees, had authorized the formation of a Cherokee
brigade,<a id="footnotetag886" name="footnotetag886"></a><a href=
"#footnote886"><sup>886</sup></a> the object being, the dislodgment
of the Federals from Fort Gibson and their consequent retirement
from the Cherokee country. The brigade had not materialized; but
all Stand Watie's subsequent efforts were directed towards the
accomplishment of its patriotic object. Love of country best
explains his whole military endeavor. The enemy in the Cherokee
country he harassed, the enemy elsewhere, he left for others to
deal with. Generally speaking, in consequence, the autumn months of
1863 found Watie hovering around the Arkansas, the Cherokees and
their neighbors with him, while Cooper, almost equally
particularistic because the Choctaws and Chickasaws were his main
support, concerned himself with plans for the recovery of Fort
Smith.</p>

<p>The fervid patriotism of one leader and the overweening personal
ambition of the other divided the Indians, then, into two camps and
it was but natural that the idea should soon evolve that Indian
interests could be best subserved by the formation of two distinct
Indian brigades. To this idea General Smith, when appealed to,
subscribed;<a id="footnotetag887" name=
"footnotetag887"></a><a href="#footnote887"><sup>887</sup></a> but
General Steele was dubious about the propriety of putting Stand
Watie in charge of one of the brigades. "He appears to exercise,"
said Steele, "no restraint over his men in keeping them together,
and his requisitions upon the depots seem to be made with utter
disregard of the numbers present or even on his rolls."<a id=
"footnotetag888" name="footnotetag888"></a><a href=
"#footnote888"><sup>888</sup></a> General Smith conceived it would
be possible, by organizing the Indians into their own brigades and
satisfying them that way, to draw off the white contingent and make
of it a separate brigade, still operating, however, within the
Indian country. To Cooper, the thought of a separate white brigade
was most unwelcome. The Indians could be an effective force only in
close conjunction with white troops. The separation of whites and
Indians would inevitably mean, although not at present intended,
the isolation of the latter and, perhaps, their ultimate
abandonment.</p>
<p>The various proposals and counter-proposals all converged in an
opposition to Steele. His presence in the Indian country seemed to
block the advancement of everybody. Cooper resented his authority
over himself and Stand Watie interpreted his waiting policy as due
to inertness and ineptitude. So small a hold did the Federals
really have on the Indian country that if Steele would only exert
himself it could easily be</p>

he was relieved, Brigadier-general Samuel B. Maxey being chosen as
his successor.<a id="footnotetag889" name=
"footnotetag889"></a><a href="#footnote889"><sup>889</sup></a>
Again Cooper had been passed over, notwithstanding that his Indian
friends had done everything they could for him. They had made

be secured for Cooper and brigadier-generalships for some of
themselves.<a id="footnotetag890" name=

Boudinot was believed by Steele to be at the bottom of the whole
scheme; but it had been in process of concoction for a long time
and Steele had few friends. General Smith was the stanchest of that
few and even Holmes<a id="footnotetag891" name=

Steele expected that the Federals would attempt a drive from Fort
Smith to the Red River and he collected what forces he could for
that contingency. Little reliance was to be placed upon the
Cherokees since they were intent upon recovering Fort Gibson; but
the Choctaws through whose country the hostile force would proceed,
were the drive made, aroused themselves as in the first days of the
war. They recruited their regiments anew</p>

<h2>XIII. ASPECTS, CHIEFLY MILITARY, 1864-1865</h2>
<p>The assignment of General Maxey to the command of Indian
Territory invigorated Confederate administration north of the Red
River, the only part of the country in undisputed occupancy. Close
upon the assumption of his new duties, came a project<a id=
"footnotetag897" name="footnotetag897"></a><a href=
"#footnote897"><sup>897</sup></a> for sweeping reforms, involving
army reorganization, camps of instruction for the Indian soldiery,
a more general enlistment, virtually conscription, of
Indians&mdash;this upon the theory that "Whosoever is not for us is
against us"&mdash;the selection of more competent and reliable
staff officers, and the adoption of such a plan of offensive
operations as would mean the retaking of Forts Smith and
Gibson.<a id="footnotetag898" name="footnotetag898"></a><a href=
"#footnote898"><sup>898</sup></a> To Maxey, thoroughly familiar
with the geography of the region, the surrender of those two places
appeared as a gross error in military technique; for the Arkansas
River was a natural line of defence, the Red was not. "If the
Indian Territory gives way," argued he, "the granary of the
Trans-Mississippi Department, the breadstuffs, and beef of this and
the Arkansas army are gone, the left flank of Holmes' army is
turned, and with it not only the meat and bread, but the salt and

<p>Army reorganization was an immense proposition and was bound to
be a difficult undertaking under the most favorable of auspices,
yet it stood as fundamental to everything else. Upon what lines
ought it to proceed? One possibility was, the formation of the two
brigades, with Stand Watie and Cooper individually in command,
which had already been suggested to General Smith and favored by
him; but which had recently been found incompatible with his latest
recommendation that all the Indian troops should be commanded,
<i>in toto</i>, by Cooper.<a id="footnotetag900" name=
"footnotetag900"></a><a href="#footnote900"><sup>900</sup></a> One
feature of great importance in its favor it had in that it did not
ostensibly run counter to the Indian understanding of their
treaties that white troops should be always associated with Indian
in the guaranteed protection of the Indian country, which was all
very well but scarcely enough to balance an insuperable objection,
which Cooper, when consulted, pointed out.<a id="footnotetag901"
name="footnotetag901"></a><a href="#footnote901"><sup>901</sup></a>
The Indians had a strong aversion to any military consolidation
that involved the elimination of their separate tribal characters.
They had allied themselves with the Confederacy as nations and as
nations they wished to fight. Moreover, due regard ought always to
be given, argued Cooper, to their tribal prejudices, their
preferences, call them what one will, and to their historical
neighborhood alliances. Choctaws and Chickasaws might well stay
together and Creeks and Seminoles; but woe betide the contrivance
that should attempt the amalgamation of Choctaws and Cherokees.</p>

<p>It seems a little strange that the Indians should so emphasize
their national individualism at this particular time, inasmuch as
six of them, the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, and
Caddo, professing to be still in strict alliance with the Southern
States, had formed an Indian confederacy, had collectively
re-asserted their allegiance, pledged their continued support, and
made reciprocal demands. All these things they had done in a joint,
or general, council, which had been held at Armstrong Academy the
previous November. Resolutions of the council, embodying the
collective pledges and demands, were even at this very moment under
consideration by President Davis and were having not a little to do
with his attitude toward the whole Maxey programme.</p>

the protection of the forces belonging to the Trans-Mississippi
Department that was assured to her while she remained one of its
integral parts. A distinct military district she should certainly
be.</p>
<p>When Davis wrote, the ambition of Cooper had, in a measure, been

Arkansas."<a id="footnotetag912" name="footnotetag912"></a><a href=

or all that he felt himself entitled to and he soon let it be known

issued from the government, although never actually delivered to
him, and, in virtue of it, he was in military command.<a id=

<p>It was hoped that prospective Indian brigades would be a

Moreover, much was expected in that direction from the reassembling
of the general council at Armstrong Academy, and much had to be;
for the times were critical. Maxey's position was not likely to be
a sinecure. As a friend wrote him,</p>

Academy, in spite of tendencies toward an isolation that, in
effect, would have been neutrality and, on the part of a few,
toward a definite retracing of steps, the southern Indians renewed
their pledges of loyalty to the Confederacy. Phillips's olive

<p>The explanation of Phillips's whole proceeding during the month
of February is to be found in his genuine friendship for the
Indian, which eventually profited him much, it is true, but, from
this time henceforth, was lifelong. He stood in somewhat of a
contrast to Blunt, whom General Steele thought unprincipled<a id=
"footnotetag933" name="footnotetag933"></a><a href=

"an old land speculator,"<a id="footnotetag934" name=

to Curtis, who was soon to show himself, as far as the Indians were
concerned, in his true colors. While Phillips was absent from Fort
Gibson, Curtis arrived there. He was making a reconnoissance of his
command and, as he passed over one reservation after another, he
doubtless coveted the Indian land for white settlement and
justified to himself a scheme of forfeiture as a way of penalizing
the red men for their defection.<a id="footnotetag935" name=

<p>Among the southern Indians, Maxey's reconstruction policy was
all this time having its effect. It was revitalizing the Indian
alliance with the Confederacy, but army conditions were yet a long
way from being satisfactory. In March Price relieved Holmes in
command of the District of Arkansas.<a id="footnotetag944" name=
"footnotetag944"></a><a href="#footnote944"><sup>944</sup></a> A
vigorous campaign was in prospect and Price asked for all the help
the department commander could afford him. The District of Indian
Territory had forces and of all the disposable Price asked the
loan. Maxey, unlike his predecessors, was more than willing to
co&ouml;perate but one difficulty, which he would fain have ignored
himself&mdash;for he was not an Albert Pike&mdash;he was compelled
to report. The Indians had to be free, absolutely free, to go or to

expected to prefer to continue the irregular warfare that he and
Adair, his colonel of scouts, had so successfully been waging for a
goodly time now. Formerly, they had waged it to Steele's great
annoyance;<a id="footnotetag946" name="footnotetag946"></a><a href=

<p>Price's call for help had come before Maxey had taken more than
the most preliminary of steps towards the reorganization of his
forces and not much was he able to do until near the end of June.
Two brigades had been formed without difficulty and Cooper had
secured his division; but after that had come protracted delay. The
nature of the delay made it a not altogether bad thing since the
days that passed were days of stirring events. In the case of Stand
Watie's First Brigade no less than of Tandy Walker's Second were
the events distinguished by measurable success. The Indians were
generally in high good humor; for even small successes, when
coupled with appreciation of effort expended, will produce that.
One adventure of Watie's, most timely and a little out of the
ordinary, had been very exhilarating. It was the seizure of a
supply boat on the Arkansas at Pheasant Bluff, not far from the
mouth of the Canadian up which the boat was towed until its
commissary stores had been extracted. The boat was the Williams,

southern Indians took up for consideration the matter of
re&euml;nlistment, the expiration "of the present term of service"

them, in their legislative and administrative capacities "such

and fitted for military service, to at once join the army and aid

headquarters, he had set up a printing press, from which issued
many and many a document, the purpose of each and every one the
same. The following quotation from one of Maxey's letters
illustrates the purpose and, at the same time, exhibits the methods
and the temper of the man behind it. The matter he was discussing
when writing was the Camden campaign, in connection with which, he
said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... In the address of General Smith the soldiers of Arkansas,
Missouri, Texas, and Louisiana are specially named. The soldiers
from this Territory bore an humbler part in the campaign, and
although they did not do a great deal, yet a fair share of the
killed, wounded, captured, and captured property and cannon can be
credited to them. I had a number of General Smith's address struck
off for circulation here, and knowing the omission would be noticed
and felt, I inserted after Louisiana, "and of the Indian
Territory," which I hope will not meet General Smith's
disapproval.</p>
<p>I would suggest that want of transportation in this Territory
will cripple movements very much....</p>
<p>During my absence General Cooper urged General McCulloch to help
him in this particular; General M. replies he can do "absolutely
nothing." I am not disposed to complain about anything, but I do
think this thing ought to be understood and regulated. Supplies of
breadstuffs and forage, as well as clothing, sugar, etc., all
having to be drawn from beyond the limits of this Territory, a more
than ordinary supply of transportation is necessary. To that for
the troops must be added that made necessary by the destitute
thrown on the hands of the Government and who must be taken care
of. I do not expect General Smith to investigate and study the

<p>of less consequence now than it had been before. The
incorporation with the Department of Arkansas and the consequent
separation from that of Kansas had been anything but a wise move.
The relations of the Indian country with the state in which its
exiles had found refuge were necessarily of the closest and
particularly so at this time when their return from exile was under
way and almost over. For reasons not exactly creditable to the
government, when all was known, Colonel Phillips had been removed
from command at Fort Gibson. At the time of Watie's raid, Colonel
C.W. Adams was the incumbent of the post; but, following it, came
Colonel S.H. Wattles<a id="footnotetag964" name=
"footnotetag964"></a><a href="#footnote964"><sup>964</sup></a> and
things went rapidly from bad to worse. The grossest corruption
prevailed and, in the midst of plenty, there was positive want.
Throughout the winter, cattle-driving was indulged in, army men,
government agents, and civilians all participating. It was only the
ex-refugee that faced starvation. All other folk grew rich.
Exploitation had succeeded neglect and Indian Territory presented
the spectacle of one of the greatest scandals of the time; but its
full story is not for recital here.</p>
<p>Great as Maxey's services to Indian Territory had been and yet
were, he was not without his traducers and Cooper was chief among
them, his overweening</p>

<p><i>Official Records</i>, vol. xli, part iii, 301. Wattles was
not at Fort Gibson a month before he was told to be prepared to
move even his Indian Brigade to Fort Smith [<i>ibid</i>., part iv,
130]. The necessity for executing the order never arose, although
all the winter there was talk off and on of abandoning Fort Gibson
entirely, sometimes also there was talk of abandoning Fort Smith.
So weak had the two places been for a long time that Cooper
insisted there was no good reason why the Confederates should not
attempt to seize them. It is interesting that Thayer notified
Wattles to be prepared to move just when there was the greatest
prospect of a Confederate Indian raid into Kansas.</p>

<p>ambition being still unsatisfied. In November, at a meeting of
the general council for the confederated tribes, Maxey spoke<a id=
"footnotetag965" name="footnotetag965"></a><a href=
"#footnote965"><sup>965</sup></a> in his own defence and spoke
eloquently; for his cause was righteous. General Smith was his

"#footnote966"><sup>966</sup></a> in the sense that he had been
Steele's; but there soon came a time when even the department

Cooper journeyed to Richmond.<a id="footnotetag967" name=

he did there can be inferred from the fact that orders were soon

<p>But Smith was mistaken in his prognostications. The change was
not just but it did work beneficially. Cooper knew how to manage
the Indians, none better, and the time was fast approaching when
they would need managing, if ever. As the absolute certainty of
Confederate defeat gradually dawned upon them, they became almost
desperate. They had to be handled very carefully lest they break
out beyond all restraint.<a id="footnotetag971" name=

December 30, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR: My letters, in respectful terms, addressed to your Adjutant
General, when I re-assumed command of the Indian Country, late in
October, have not been fortunate enough to be honored with a reply.
This will reach you through another medium, and so that others
besides yourself shall know its contents. I am no longer an officer
under you, but a private citizen, and <i>free</i>, so far as any
citizen of Arkansas can call himself free while he lives in this
State; and I will see whether you are as impervious to <i>all</i>
other considerations, as you are to all sense of courtesy and
justice.</p>
<p>You were sent out to Arkansas with certain <i>positive</i>
orders, which you were <i>immediately</i> to enforce. You
<i>knew</i> that "Gen Hindman never was the commanding General of
the Trans. Mississippi Department," and was not sent there by the
War Department; and that, <i>therefore</i> and <i>of course</i>,
all his orders were illegal, for want of power. You <i>knew</i>
that he never had any right to interfere with my command in the
Department of Indian Territory, to take away my troops and
ordnance, or to send me <i>any</i> orders whatever; and that
<i>therefore</i> I was <i>wholly</i> in the right, in all my
controversy with him. You <i>knew</i>, also, that in stripping the
Indian Country of troops, artillery, arms and ammunition, he had
been guilty of multiplied outrages, contrary to the will and policy
of the President, forbidden by the Secretary of War for the future,
and hostile to the interests of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>I had been advised by the Secretary of War, on the 14th of July,
before <i>you</i> were unfortunately thought of [in] connection
with the Trans. Mississippi Department, that Gen. Magruder was
assigned to the command of it; and that although I would be under
his command, it was not doubted that my relations with him would be
pleasant and harmonious, and that I would have such latitude in
command of the Indian country, as might be necessary for me to</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg

<p>act to the best advantage in its defence. And by the same letter
I was advised, that it was regretted I had met with so many
embarrassments in procuring supplies; and that an order had been
issued from the Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, to prevent
the pursuing of such courses as I had complained of, in the seizure
of what I had procured; and the Secretary said it was to be hoped
that neither I nor any other officer would hereafter have cause to
complain of supplies being diverted from their legitimate
destination. And that Gen. Magruder might fully understand my
position, &amp;c., a copy of my letter of 8th June, to General
Hindman, stating in detail the plundering process to which the
Indian Service had before then been subjected, was furnished to the
former officer. Three several copies of this letter were sent me,
that it might be certain to reach me.</p>
<p>I do not repeat the substance of that letter, for <i>your</i>
benefit. You have known it, no doubt, ever since you left Richmond.
You told me in August, that the War Department was fully informed
in regard to the matters between myself and Generals Van Dorn and
Hindman. You spoke it in the way of a taunt, and as if the
Department justified them and condemned me. You <i>meant</i> me so
to understand it. You are a <i>very</i> ingenious person; inasmuch
as you <i>knew</i> the exact contrary to be true. When I afterwards
received the Secretary's letter, I remembered your remark, and did
not doubt, and do not now doubt, that when you were substituted for
Gen. Magruder, you received the same instructions that had been
given <i>him</i> and were yourself furnished with a copy of the
same letter, for the same purpose.</p>
<p>At all events, you were sent out to put an end to his outrages,
and to avert, if you could, the mischiefs about to spring from
them. But when you reached Little Rock, you found him there, and
you found that the troops, artillery, ammunition and stores that
had reached and were on their way there from the Indian Country,
under his unrighteous orders, <i>and which it was your duty to
restore to me</i>, were too valuable to be parted with, if that
could be in any way avoided. Probably you foresaw that you might,
by and by need to seize money and supplies procured by me.
Twenty-six pieces of artillery, a supply of fixed ammunition and
other trifles, on hand, with $1,350,000 in money, and over 6,000
suits of clothing in prospect, were the bait Hindman had to tempt
you withal; and for it you</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg
339]</span>
<p>sold your soul, as Faust sold his to Mephistopheles. Your
Lieutenant became your master; you found it convenient to believe
his version of every thing, and to justify him in every thing, and
you ended in making all his devilments your own, and adopting the
whole infernal spawn and brood, with additions of your own to the
family.</p>
<p>You told me in August, that you had been prepared to judge me
favorably, until you read my address to the Indians on resigning my
command, but after that, you could not judge me fairly. I did not
in the least doubt the <i>fact</i>; but I did <i>not</i> believe
the <i>reason</i>. What, moreover, had <i>you</i> to <i>judge</i>
in regard to <i>me</i>? You were not sent to <i>judge</i> any body.
Hindman was the criminal you <i>were</i> to operate upon.</p>
<p>And, if you were sent, or had otherwise any right, to judge
<i>me</i>, you administered the sort of justice that is in vogue in
hell. Before you <i>saw me, you heard him</i>. You adopted all his
views, and never asked me a question in regard to our controversy,
or as to my own action, or the condition of things in the Indian
Country. I had been infamously and assiduously slandered, from the
moment when I began to resist his illegal, impolitic and outrageous
attempts to deprive the Indian Department of every thing, to make
it a mere appanage of, and appendix to, North-Western Arkansas, to
take the Indians again out of their own country, and to compel me
to unite in that insane and miserable "expedition into Missouri,"
which was projected and planned by Folly, mis-managed and
misconducted by Imbecility and ended, as I knew it would, in
disaster and disgrace. Lies of all varieties were ingeniously and
laboriously invented at and about Head Quarters, and despatches, by
special and <i>fit</i> agents, to be industriously circulated
throughout the Indian Country and Texas, as well as Arkansas. The
Indians were told that I had carried away into Texas the gold and
silver belonging to <i>them</i>; while the Texans were made to
believe that I was paying <i>their</i> moneys to the Indians. It
was reported, in Bonham, Texas, by officers sent from Hindman's
Head Quarters, that I was defaulter to the amount of $125,000 and
at last there crawled out from the sewer under the throne, and
sneaked about the Indian Country and Texas, the damnable lie, that
an Indian had been taken, bearing letters from me to the Northern
Indians, or, to the enemy in Kansas; or, as another version had it,
from Gen. James H. Lane to me; and</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg
340]</span>
<p>three months ago it was whispered about that I was a member of
the secret disloyal organization in Northern Texas. Such lies could
have been counted by scores. Most of them are dead and rotten; but
some still live, by means of assiduous nursing. And all these lies,
and more either you or Hindman sent to the President at
Richmond.</p>
<p>I say, sir, you never <i>inquired</i> into <i>any</i> thing. You
never wished to <i>hear</i> any thing, whatever from <i>me</i>. You
disobeyed the orders with which you were sent as a public curse and
calamity into Arkansas, as if the State were not already
sufficiently infested by Hindman. Is it true that he has lately,
upon his single order, and without the ceremony of even a
<i>mock</i> trial, caused three men "suspected of disloyalty" to be
shot; and that, two of them being proven to him to be true Southern
men, he sent a reprieve, which, either setting out too late, or
lagging on the way, reached the scene of murder after their blood
had bathed the desecrated soil of Arkansas? It has come to me so,
from officers direct from Fort Smith. At any rate, he has put to
death nine or ten persons, without any legal trial. Who is
<i>he</i>, that he should do these things in this nineteenth
century? And who are <i>you</i>, sir, that you should suffer, and
by suffering, <i>approve</i> and adopt them? How many <i>more</i>
murders will suffice to awaken public vengeance?</p>
<p>Was the Star Chamber any worse than Hindman's Military
Commissions, that are ordered to preserve no records? Were the
<i>Lettres de Cachet</i> of Louis XV, any greater outrage on the
personal liberty of <i>French subjects</i>, than Hindman's arrests
and committal to the Penitentiary of <i>suspected</i> persons? Was
Tristan l'Hermite any more the minister of tyranny, than his
Provost Marshals? or Caligula, Caesar Borgia or Colonel Kirke any
more cruel and remorseless than he, that you have sustained all his
acts, and made all his atrocities your own? Take care, sir! You are
not so high, that you may not be reached by the arm of justice. The
President is above you both, and God is above him, and
<i>sometimes</i> interferes in human affairs.</p>
<p>Unless the late Secretary of War, through the President, sent an
official falsehood to the Congress of the Confederate States, you
were sent to Arkansas with <i>positive</i> and <i>unconditional</i>
instructions, that, if Gen. Hindman <i>had</i> declared Martial Law
in Arkansas, and adopted oppressive police regulations under it,
<i>you should rescind the</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg
341]</span>
<p><i>declarations of Martial Law, and the Regulations adopted to
carry it into effect</i>. You have not done so. You have not only
<i>not</i> rescinded <i>any</i> thing; but you have, by a General
Order, long ago, continued in force all orders of General Hindman,
not specially revoked by you. That order could have no retroactive
effect, to make <i>his</i> orders <i>to have been valid</i> in the
<i>past</i>. It could only put them in force for the <i>future</i>;
and you thereby made them <i>your</i> orders, as fully as if you
had re-issued them. In so doing, you became the enemy of your
country, if not of the Human race, and outlawed yourself.</p>
<p>You have <i>yourself</i> established a tariff of prices
exclusively on articles produced by the farmers, including the
sweet potatoes raised by old women and superannuated negroes. You
leave the Jews and extortioners, some of the former of whom go
about in uniforms, claiming to be <i>officers</i> and your agents
to charge these same venders of produce, whatever infamous prices
they please for wares they need to purchase with the pittances
received according to your scale of prices, for the vegetables that
supply your and other tables.</p>
<p>You pretend, I learn, that the President gave you discretionary
power, in regard to Martial Law, and the Regulations in question. I
do not believe it; for, if he did, then he and the Secretary
intentionally deceived Congress by the equivalent of a lie. Do you
pretend that the President paltered with Congress in a double
sense? I put you face to face. Is it <i>your</i> act, in
<i>defiance</i> of orders, that continues Martial Law in force in
Arkansas, stifles freedom of speech, muzzles the Press, tramples on
all the rights at once of the People of that State, and makes the
State itself only a congregation of Helots, incompetent to be
represented in Congress? Is it merely a contest between you and
Phelps, <i>which</i> of the two shall be Military Governor? If it
<i>is</i> your act, then justice ought at once to be done upon you,
lest the President, winking at the outrage, and not stripping from
your back your uniform of Lieutenant General, should deserve to be
impeached, as your accomplice.</p>
<p>Or, do you dare assert that it is <i>his</i> act, because he
gave you discretionary power on the subject, after informing
Congress that Hindman never was Commanding General of the
Department, and that you had been ordered to rescind his
declaration of Martial Law,&mdash;nay, after publicly proclaiming
that <i>no</i> General had any power to declare Martial Law? All
the Confederacy thanked and applauded</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg
342]</span>
<p>him for so striking at the root of an immense outrage and abuse
and an unexpected public course; but if he has authorized or
sanctions <i>your</i> course, he is unworthy longer to be
President. If he has not, you have defied his orders and justified
men in judging yourself authorized and him guilty; and so you are
unworthy longer to be General.</p>
<p>When I saw you in August, you were greatly exercised on the
subject of my printed address to the Indians, publication of which
in Little Rock you had suppressed, <i>as if it could do any harm in
Arkansas</i>. You suppressed it, because it exposed those whose
acts were losing the Indian Country. You wanted to keep what had
been taken from <i>me</i>, and to escape damnation for the probable
<i>consequences</i> of the acts, the <i>profit</i> of which you
were reluctant to part with. I do not wonder the letter troubled
you; for it told <i>the truth</i>, and condemned and denounced in
advance <i>more</i> unjustifiable courses of conduct that you were
about to pursue.</p>
<p>You pretended that it had produced a great "ferment" among the
Indians; and that even many of the Chickasaws had in consequence of
it, left the service. It had produced <i>no</i> ferment, and
<i>none</i> of the Chickasaws had left us. On the contrary, the
Indians were quieted by it, the Creeks re-organized, in numbers,
two regiments, and the Chickasaws five companies. That was its
purpose, and such was its effect.</p>
<p>But to <i>you</i>, its enormity consisted in its exposure of the
conduct of two Major Generals. I told the Indians <i>plainly</i>,
that it was not <i>my</i> fault or the fault of the Government, but
of these two Generals, that moneys, clothing, arms and ammunition,
procured for them, had not reached them; that troops raised for
service among them had never entered their country; and that,
finally, troops, artillery and ammunition were carried out of it.
This censure of my <i>superiors</i>, in vindication of the
President and Government, shocked your tender sensibilities. You
were ready to follow in their footsteps, and already <i>had</i> the
plunder; and you told me that "the act of the officer was the act
of the Government." Did you really <i>mean</i>, that the Indians
should have been led or left to suppose that these acts were the
acts of the Government? That would have been <i>almost</i> as great
an infamy, as it was to <i>take</i> the supplies, and so give them
cause and reason to believe the robbery the act of the Government,
<i>and thus excite them to revolt</i>. Moreover, when I told you
that the act of</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg
343]</span>
<p>the officer was <i>not</i>, in the case in question, the act of
the Government; that, if I had permitted the Indians to suppose so,
they would long have left us; and that, to quiet them, I had been
compelled, for three months and more than a hundred times, to
explain to them what had become of their supplies, and how and by
whom they have been seized, you admitted that "that was right for
local explanation." As there could be no objection to telling all,
what I had often told part, that <i>they</i> might tell the rest;
and as it was no more a crime to <i>print</i> than to <i>say</i>
it; I have the right to believe and I <i>do</i> believe that your
<i>real</i> objection to its publication was that it exposed <i>to
our own people the actual</i> conduct of other Generals, and the
<i>intended</i> conduct of yourself. Have <i>you</i> left the
Indians to believe that the late seizure and appropriation, by
<i>yourself</i>, of their clothing and moneys, is the act of the
Government? If you have, you ought to be shot as a Traitor, for
provoking them to revolt, and giving aid and comfort to the
enemy.</p>
<p>But you told me, that when you first read my letter, you held up
your hands, and exclaimed, "What! is the man a Traitor?" And you
said that not one of my friends in Little Rock, and I had, you
said, a great many, pretended to justify the letter. You have never
found a friend of mine, or an indifferent person, silly enough to
think, like you, that it savored of treason. It is only rarely one
meets a man so scantily furnished with sense as to misunderstand
and pervert what is written in plain English. I was vindicating
myself, and still more the Government, and persuading the Indians
to remain loyal, notwithstanding the wrongs they had endured. I,
too, was an officer; and <i>my</i> acts <i>had</i> been the acts of
the Government. <i>My</i> promises to them were <i>its</i>
promises. The procuring of supplies by <i>me</i>, was <i>its</i>
act; and when, reaching or not reaching the frontier, the supplies
were like the unlucky traveler, who journeyed from Jerusalem to
Jericho, <i>then</i> the Government <i>ceased</i> to act, and
unlicensed outrage took its place. And, further, <i>my</i> act was
the act of the Government, when I told the Indians <i>why</i> they
had not received their supplies and money, and vindicated that
Government at the expense of those who were guilty of the act; and
who having done it and reaped the profit, should not be heard to
object that all the world should know what they did, nor be allowed
to escape the responsibility of <i>all</i> the consequences.</p>
<p>If to tell the Indians that other Generals had wrongfully
stopped</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg
344]</span>
<p>their supplies, in any degree <i>resembled</i> Treason, that
could only be so, because it <i>was</i> treason to <i>do</i> the
act. It cannot be wrong to make known what it was right and proper
to do. The truth is, that the acts done were outrages, which it was
desirable for the doers to conceal from the Indians. I refused to
become a party to those outrages, by concealing them. I would not
agree in advance to be <i>silent</i>, when <i>you</i> should repeat
and improve on those outrages, and consummate what had been so
felicitously begun.</p>
<p>I do not doubt that there are assassins wearing uniforms, who
are knaves enough to <i>pretend</i> to read my letter as you do,
and to see in it the desire of a disappointed man to be revenged,
even by the ruin of his country. Power always has its pimps and
catamites. These would no doubt gladly have made my letter the
means of murdering me by that devilish engine of Military
despotism, a Military commission, that is <i>ordered</i> to
preserve no records. You, I think really look upon it with alarm.
It is, no doubt, <i>very</i> desirable to <i>you</i>, that the
blame of losing the Indian Country, which, if not already a fact
accomplished, is a fact inevitable, should be made to fall upon me.
You, as the pliant and useful implement of Gen. Hindman, are the
cause of this loss; and you know I can prove it. You and he have
left nothing <i>undone</i>, that <i>could</i> be done, to lose it.
And you may rest assured, that whether I live or die, you shall not
escape one jot or tittle of the deep damnation to which you are
richly entitled for causing a loss so irretrievable, so astounding,
so unnecessary and so <i>fatal</i>, and one which it will be
impossible to excuse as owing to ignorance and stupidity. No degree
of <i>these</i> misfortunes, can be pleaded in bar of judgment.
<i>You</i> will have <i>forced</i> the Indians to go to the North
for protection. <i>You</i> will have <i>given away</i> their
country to the enemy. <i>You</i> will have turned their arms
against us. You will have done this by disobeying the orders of
your Government, continuing the courses it condemned, and to put an
end to which it sent you out here; by falsifying its pledges and
promises, taking for others' uses the moneys which it sent out to
pay the Indians, robbing them of the clothing sent by it to cover
their nakedness, and thus thrusting aside all the considerations of
common honesty, of justice, of humanity, and even of policy,
expediency and common sense.</p>
<p>When Mr. C.B. Johnson agreed, in September to loan your
Quartermaster at Little Rock, $350,000 of the money he was</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg
345]</span>
<p>conveying to Major Quesenbury, the Quartermaster of the
Department of Indian Territory, <i>you promised</i> him that it
should be repaid to Major Quesenbury as soon as you should receive
funds, and before he would have disposed of the remaining million.
<i>You got the money by means of that promise; and you did not keep
the promise</i>. On the contrary, by an order that reached Fort
Smith three hours before Mr. Johnson did, you compelled Major
Quesenbury, the moment he received the money, to turn every dollar
of it, over to a <i>Commissary</i> at Fort Smith; <i>and it was
used to supply the needs of Gen. Hindman's troops</i>; when the
Seminoles, fourteen months in the service have never been paid a
dollar; and the Chickasaw and Choctaw Battalion, and Chilly
McIntosh's Creeks, each corps a year and more in the service, have
received only $45,000 each, and no clothing. Was this violation of
your promise, the act of the Government?</p>
<p>To replace the clothing I had procured for the Indians in
December, 1861, and which, with near 1,000 tents, fell into the
hands of the troops of Generals Price and Van Dorn, I sent an
agent, in June, to Richmond, who went to Georgia, and there
procured some 6,500 suits, with about 3,000 shirts and 3,000 pairs
of drawers, and some two or three hundred tents. These supplies
were at Monroe early in September; and the Indians were informed
that they and the moneys had been procured and were on the way. The
good news went all over their country, as if on the wings of the
wind; and universal content and rejoicing were the
consequences.</p>
<p>The clothing reached Fort Smith; and its issue to Gen. Hindman's
people commenced immediately. I sent a Quartermaster for it and he
was retained there. If <i>any</i> of it has ever reached the
Indians, it has been only recently, and but a small portion of
it.</p>
<p>You pretend to believe that the Indians were in a "ferment" and
discontented; and you took this very opportune occasion to stop all
the moneys due their troops and for debts in their country and take
and appropriate to the use of other troops the clothing promised to
and procured for <i>them</i>. The clothing and the money were
<i>theirs</i>; and you were in possession of an order from the War
Department, forbidding you to divert any supplies from their
legitimate destination; an order which was issued, <i>as you
knew</i>, in consequence of <i>my</i> complaints, and to prevent
moneys and supplies for the <i>Indians</i> being stopped: <i>and
yet you stopped all</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg
346]</span>
<p>You borrow part of the money, and then seize the rest, like a
<i>genteel</i> highwayman, who first borrows all he can of a
traveler, on promise of punctual re-payment; and then claps a
pistol to his head, and orders him to "stand and deliver" the rest.
And you did even more than this.</p>
<p>For you promised the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs, when
he was at Little Rock, about the 1st of October, on his way to the
Indian Country, to give the Indians assurances of the good faith of
the Government&mdash;<i>you promised him</i>, I say, <i>that the
clothing in question should go to the Indians</i>. He told the
Chickasaws and Seminoles, at least, of this promise. You broke it.
You did <i>not</i> send them the clothing. You placed the
Commissioner and the Government in an admirable attitude before the
Indians; and the consequence has been, I understand, the disbanding
of the Chickasaws, and the failure of the Seminole troops to
re-organize. The consequence will be far more serious yet. Indians
cannot be deceived, and promises made them shamelessly broken, with
impunity.</p>
<p>While <i>you</i> were thus stopping their clothing, and robbing
the half-naked Indians to clothe other troops, the Federals were
sending home the Choctaws whom they had taken prisoners, after
clothing them comfortably and putting money in their pockets. No
one need be astonished, when <i>all</i> the Indians shall have
turned their arms against us.</p>
<p>Why did you and Gen. Hindman not procure by your own exertions
what you need for your troops? He reached Little Rock on the 31st
of May. You came here in August. I sent my agents to Richmond, for
money and clothing, in June and July. I never asked either of
<i>you</i> for <i>any</i> thing. I could procure for <i>my</i>
command all I wanted. You and he were Major Generals; I, only a
Brigadier; and Brigadiers are plenty as blackberries in season. It
is to be supposed that if I could procure money, clothing and
supplies for <i>Indians</i>, you and he could do so for white
troops. Both of you come blundering out to Arkansas with nothing,
and supply yourselves with what <i>I</i> procure. Some officers
would be ashamed <i>so</i> to supply deficiencies caused by their
own want of foresight, energy or sense.</p>
<p><i>You</i> do not even know you need an Engineer, until one of
mine comes by, with $20,000 in his hands for Engineer Service in
the</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg
347]</span>
<p>Indian Territory, some of which belongs to <i>me</i> for
advances made, and with stationery and instruments procured by
<i>me</i>, for <i>my</i> Department, in Richmond, a year ago; and
<i>then</i> you find out that there are such things as Engineers,
and that you need one; and you seize on Engineer, money, and
stationery. You even take, notwithstanding Paragraph VI, of General
Orders No. 50, the stationery procured by me for the Adjutant
General's Office of my Department, by purchase in Richmond in
December, 1861; for the want of which I had been compelled to
permit my own private stock to be used for months.</p>
<p>I no longer wonder that you do these things. When you told me
that you could not judge me fairly, because I told the Indians that
others had done them injustice, you confessed much more than you
intended. It was a pregnant sentence you uttered. By it you judged
and convicted yourself, and pronounced <i>your own sentence</i>,
when you uttered <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>The Federal authorities were proposing to the Indians <i>at the
very time when you stopped their clothing and money</i>, that, if
they would return to the old Union, they should not be asked to
take up arms, their annuities should be paid them in money, the
negroes taken from them be restored, all losses and damage
sustained by them be paid for, and they be allowed to retain, as so
much clear profit, what had been paid them by the Confederate
States. It was a liberal offer and a great temptation, to come at
the moment when you and Hindman were felicitously completing your
operations, and when there were no breadstuffs in their country,
and they and their women and children were starving and half-naked.
You chose an admirable opportunity to rob, to disappoint, to
outrage and exasperate them, and make your own Government
fraudulent and contemptible in their eyes. If any human action
<i>can</i> deserve it, the hounds of hell ought to hunt your soul
and Hindman's for it through all eternity.</p>
<p>Instead of co-operating with the Federal authorities, and doing
all that he and you <i>could</i> do to induce the Indians to listen
to and accept their propositions, <i>he</i> had better have
expelled the enemy from Arkansas or "have perished in the attempt;"
and you had better have marched on Helena, before its
fortifications were finished, and purged the eastern part of the
State of the enemy's presence. If you had succeeded as admirably in
that, as you have in losing</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg
348]</span>
<p>the Indian Country, you would have merited the eternal gratitude
of Arkansas, instead of its execrations; and the laurel, instead of
a halter. I said that you and your Lieutenant had left
<i>nothing</i> undone. I repeat it. Take another <i>small</i>
example. Until I left the command, at the end of July, the Indian
troops had regularly had their half rations of coffee. As soon as I
was got rid of, an order from Gen. Hindman took all the remaining
coffee, some 3,000 lbs., to Fort Smith. Even in this small matter,
he could not forego an opportunity of injuring and disappointing
them.</p>
<p>You asked me, in August, what was the need of any white troops
at all, in the Indian Country; and you said that the few mounted
troops, I had, if kept in the Northern part of the Cherokee
Country, would have been enough to repel any Federal force that
ever would have entered it. As you and Hindman never allowed any
ammunition procured by me, to reach the Indian Country, if you
could prevent it, whether I obtained it at Richmond or Corinth, or
in Texas, and as you approve of his course in taking out of that
country all that was to be found in it, I am entitled to suppose
that you regarded ammunition for the Indians as little necessary,
as troops to protect them in conformity to the pledge of honor of
the Government. One thing, however, is to be said to the credit of
your next in command. When he has ordered anything to be seized, he
has never denied having done so, or tried to cast responsibility on
an inferior. After you had written to me that you had ordered Col.
Darnell to seize, at Dallas, Texas, ammunition furnished by me, you
denied to him, I understand, that you had given the order. Is it
so? and <i>did</i> he refuse to trust the order in your hands, or
even to let you see it, but would show it to Gen. McCulloch?</p>
<p>Probably you know by this time, if you are capable of learning
<i>any</i> thing, whether any white troops are needed in the Indian
Country. The brilliant result of Gen. Hindman's profound
calculations and masterly strategy, and of his long-contemplated
invasion of Missouri, is before the country; and the disgraceful
rout at Fort Wayne, with the manoeuvres and results on the
Arkansas, are pregnant commentaries on the abuse lavished on me,
for not taking "the line of the Arkansas," or making Head Quarters
on Spring River, with a force too small to effect any thing any
where.</p>
<p>I have not spoken of your Martial Law and Provost Marshals</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg
349]</span>
<p>in the Indian Country, and your seizure of salt-works there, or,
in detail, of your seizure of ammunition procured by me in Texas,
and on its way to the Indian troops, of the withdrawal of all white
troops and artillery from their country, of the retention for other
troops of the mountain howitzers procured by me for Col. Waitie,
and the ammunition sent me, for them and for small arms, from
Richmond. This letter is but a part of the indictment I will prefer
bye and bye, when the laws are no longer silent, and the
constitution and even public opinion no longer lie paralyzed under
the brutal heel of Military Power; and when the results of your
<i>im</i>policy and <i>mis</i>management shall have been fully
developed.</p>
<p>But I have a word or two to say as to myself. From the time when
I entered the Indian Country, in May, 1861, to make Treaties, until
the beginning of June, 1862, when Gen. Hindman, in the plentitude
of his self-conceit and folly, assumed absolute control of the
Military and other affairs of the Department of Indian Territory,
and commenced plundering it of troops, artillery and ammunition,
dictating Military operations, and making the Indian country an
appanage of Northwestern Arkansas, there was profound peace
throughout its whole extent. Even with the wild Camanches and
Kiowas, I had secured friendly relations. An unarmed man could
travel in safety and alone, from Kansas to Red River, and from the
Arkansas line to the Wichita Mountains. The Texan frontier had not
been as perfectly undisturbed for years. We had fifty-five hundred
Indians in service, under arms, and they were as loyal as our own
people, little as had been done by any one save myself to keep them
so, and much as had been done by others to alienate them. They
referred all their difficulties to me for decision, and looked to
me alone to see justice done them and the faith of Treaties
preserved.</p>
<p>Most of the time without moneys (those sent out to that
Department generally failing to reach it) I had managed to keep the
white and Indian troops better fed than any other portion of the
troops of the Confederacy any where. I had 26 pieces of artillery,
two of the batteries as perfectly equipped and well manned as any,
any where. I had on hand and on the way, an ample supply of
ammunition, after being once plundered. While in command, <i>I had
procured, first and last</i>, 36,000 pounds of rifle and cannon
powder. If you would like to know, sir, how I effected this, in the
face</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg
350]</span>
<p>of all manner of discouragements and difficulties, it is no
secret. My disbursing officers can tell you who supplied them with
funds for many weeks, and whose means purchased horses for the
artillery. Ask the Chickasaws and Seminoles who purchased the only
shoes they had received&mdash;four hundred pairs, at five dollars
each, procured and paid for by <i>me</i>, in Bonham, and which I
sent up to them after I was taken "in personal custody" in
November.</p>
<p><i>You</i> dare pretend, sir, that <i>I</i> might be disloyal,
or even in thought couple the word Treason with <i>my</i> name.
What <i>peculiar</i> merit is it in <i>you</i> to serve on our side
in this war? You were bred a soldier, and your only chance for
distinction lay in obtaining promotion in the army, and in the army
of the Confederacy. You <i>were</i> Major, or something of the
sort, in the old army, and you <i>are</i> a Lieutenant General.
Your reward I think, for what you have done or not done, is
sufficient.</p>
<p>I was a private citizen, over fifty years of age, and neither
needing nor desiring military rank or civil honors. I accepted the
office of Commissioner, at the President's <i>solicitation</i>. I
took that of Brigadier General, with all the odium that I knew
would follow it, and fall on me as the Leader of a force of
Indians, knowing there would be little glory to be reaped, and
wanting no promotion, simply and solely to see <i>my</i> pledges to
the Indians carried out, to keep them loyal to us, to save their
country to the Confederacy, and to preserve the Western frontier of
Arkansas and the Northern frontier of Texas from devastation and
desolation.</p>
<p>What has been my <i>reward</i>? All my efforts have been
rendered nugatory, and my attempts even to <i>collect</i> and
<i>form</i> an army frustrated, by the continual plundering of my
supplies and means by other Generals, and your and their deliberate
efforts to disgust and alienate the Indians. Once before this, an
armed force was sent to arrest me. You all disobeyed the
President's orders, and treated me as a criminal for endeavoring to
have them carried out. The whole country swarms with slanders
against me; and at last, because I felt constrained reluctantly to
re-assume command, after learning that the President would not
accept my resignation, I am taken from Tishomingo to Washington, a
prisoner, under an armed guard, it having been deemed necessary,
for the sake of effect, to send two hundred and fifty men into the
Indian Country to arrest me. <i>The Senatorial election was at
hand</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg
351]</span>
<p>I had, unaided and alone, <i>secured</i> to the Confederacy a
magnificent country, equal in extent, fertility, beauty and
resources to any of our States&mdash;nay, superior to any. I had
secured the means, in men and arms, of keeping it. I knew how only
it could be defended. I asked no aid of any of you. I only asked to
be let alone. Verily, I have my reward also, as Hastings had his,
for winning India for the British Empire.</p>
<p>It is <i>your</i> day <i>now</i>. You sit above the laws and
domineer over the constitution. "Order reigns in Warsaw." But bye
and bye, there will be a <i>just</i> jury empannelled, who will
hear <i>all</i> the testimony and decide impartially&mdash;no less
a jury than the People of the Confederate States; and for their
verdict as to myself, I and my children will be content to wait; as
also for the sure and stern sentence and universal malediction,
that will fall like a great wave of God's just anger on you and the
murderous miscreant by whose malign promptings you are making
yourself accursed.</p>
<p>Whether I am respectfully yours, you will be able to determine
from the contents of this letter.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; "Pickett Papers."</p>
<p>State papers of the Southern Confederacy now lodged in the
Library of Congress. Had Pike continued to prosecute his mission
under the auspices of the State Department, these papers would
undoubtedly have contained much of value for the present work, but
as it is they yield only an occasional document and that of very
incidental importance. The papers used were found in packages 81,
86, 88, 93, 95, 106, 107, 109, 113, 118. The "Pickett Papers" were
originally in the hands of Secretary Benjamin. After coming into
the possession of the United States government, they were at first
confided to the care of the Treasury Department and were handed
over later, by direction of the president, to the Library of
Congress. The fact of their being in the charge of the Treasury
Department explains the circumstance of its possession of the
original treaty made by Pike with the Comanches, and the fact that
that manuscript turned up long after the main body of "Pickett
Papers" had been transferred to the Congressional Library suggests
the possibility that detached Confederate records may yet repose in
the recesses of the Treasury archives. Between the dates of their
consignment and their transfer, they must have become to some
degree disintegrated. The War Department borrowed some of the
Pickett Papers for inclusion in the <i>Official Records of the War
of the Rebellion</i>.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash; Records, or Archives.</p>
<p>Among these, which are to-day in the War Department in charge of
the Chief Clerk of the Adjutant-general's Office, are the
following:</p>
<p>Chap. 2, no. 258, Letter Book, Brig. Gen. D.H. Cooper, C.S.A.,
Ex officio Indian Agent, etc., May 10-27, 1865 (File Mark, W.
236).</p>
<p>It is a mere fragment. Its wrapper bears the following
endorsement: War Department, Archive Office, Chap. 2, No. 258.</p>
<p>Chap. 2, no. 270, Letter Book, Col. and Brig. Gen. Win. Steele's
command.</p>
<p>The contents are,</p>
<p>a. A few letters dealing with Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico,
March to July, 1862, pp. 7-22. These letters emanated from the</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg

<p>authority of William Steele, Colonel of the Seventh Regiment of
Texas Mounted Volunteers.</p>
<p>b. Letters dealing with matters in the Department of Indian
Territory, January 8, 1863 to May 18, 1863, pp. 27-254. Pages 1-6,
23-26, and 47 and 48 are missing.</p>
<p>The list of the whole, as given, is,</p>
<p>Letters Sent&mdash;Col. and Brig. Gen. Wm. Steele's

<p>6. Dept. of Indian Territory, Jan. 21 to May 18, 1863.</p>
<p>Chap. 2, no. 268, Letters Sent, Department of Indian Territory,
from May 19, 1863 to September 27, 1863.</p>
<p>This is another William Steele letter book, but is not quite
complete. In point of time covered, it succeeds no. 270 and is
itself succeeded by no. 267.</p>
<p>Chap. 2, no. 267, Letters Sent, September 28, 1863 to June 17,
1864.</p>
<p>Pages 3 to 6, inclusive, are missing and there are no letters
after page 119.</p>
<p>Chap. 2, no. 259, Inspector General's Letters and Reports, from
April 23, 1864, to May 15, 1865.</p>
<p>The cover has this as title: Letter Book A: Insp't Gen'l's
Office&mdash;Dis't of Indian Ter'y From April 23rd, 1864 to May 15,
1865. On the inside of the front cover, appears this in pencil:
"Received from Gen'l M.J. Wright, Oct. 16/79." Some pages at the
beginning of the book have been cut out. Between pages 145 and 196,
are reports, variously signed, some by E.E. Portlock, some by N.W.
Battle, and some by James Patteson.</p>
<p>Chap. 2, no. 260, District of the Indian Territory, Inspector
General's Letter Book, April 23, 1864 to January 7, 1865.</p>
<p>"Received from Gen'l M.J. Wright, Oct. 16/79." From a comparison
of nos. 259 and 260, it is seen that no. 259 is a rough letter and
report book and that no. 260 is a finished product. The 1864
material in no. 259 is duplicated by that in no. 260.</p>
<p>Chap. 7, no. 36. Indian Treaties.</p>
<p>Chap. 7, no. 48. Regulations adopted by the War Department, on
the 15th of April 1862, for carrying into effect the Acts of
Congress of the Confederate States, Relating to Indian Affairs,
etc. (Richmond, 1862).</p>
<p>On page 1, is to be found, "Regulations for Carrying into
effect, the Act of Congress of the Confederate States, approved May
21, 1861, entitled An Act for the protection of certain Indian
Tribes, and of other Acts relating to Indian Affairs."</p>

<p>"PIKE PAPERS." On subjects other than Indian, extant manuscripts
written and received by Albert Pike are exceedingly numerous. One
collection of his personal papers is in the possession of Mr. Fred
Allsopp of Little Rock; but the largest proportion of those of more
general interest, as also of more special, is in the Scottish Rite
Temple, Washington, D.C., under the care of Mr. W.L. Boyden. Three
things only deserve particular mention; viz.,</p>
<p>a. Autobiography of General Albert Pike. A bound typewritten
manuscript, "from stenographic notes, furnished by himself."</p>
<p>b. Confederate States, a/c's with. These papers are in a small
file-box and are chiefly receipts from John Crawford, Matthew
Leefer, Douglas H. Cooper, John Jumper, and</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg
358]</span>
<p>others for money advanced to them and vouchers for purchases
made by Pike. There are three personal letters in the box: D.H.
Cooper to Pike, July 28, 1873; William Quesenbury to Pike, August
10, 1873; William Quesenbury to Pike, August 11, 1873. All three
letters have to do with a certain $5000 seemingly unaccounted for,
a subject in controversy between Pike and Cooper, reflecting upon
the latter's integrity. One of the papers is an itemized account of
the money Pike expended for the Indians, money "placed in his hands
to be disbursed among the Indian Tribes under Treaty stipulations
in January, A.D. 1862." It contains an enclosure, the receipt
signed by Edward Cross, depositary, showing that Pike restored to
the Confederate Treasury the unexpended balance, $19,263 10/100
specie, $49,980 55/100, treasury notes. The receipt is dated Little
Rock, March 13, 1863.</p>
<p>c. Choctaw Case. Two packages of papers come under this heading.
One is of manuscript matter mainly, the other of printed matter
solely. In the latter is the <i>Memorial of P.P. Pitchlynn</i>,
House Miscellaneous Documents, no. 89, 43d congress, first session,
and on it Pike has inscribed, "Written by me, Albert Pike."</p>

<p>The files run in two distinct series. One series has its
material arranged in boxes, the other, in bundles. The former
comprises letters from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs only, and
has been examined to the extent here given,</p>

<p>The latter were difficult of discovery. After an exhausting
search, however, they were located on a top-most shelf, under the
roof, in the file-room off from the gallery in the Patent Office
building. The bundles are small and each is bandaged as were the
Indian Office files, originally. The bandage, or wrapper, is
labelled according to the contents. For example, one bundle is
labelled, "No. 1, 1849-1864, War;" another, "No. 24, 1852-1868,
Exec." In the first are letters from the War Department, in the
second, from the White House. Some of the letters are from a</p>

<p>Department of the Interior, Register Books, "Register of Letters
Received," Corresponding to the two series of files, are two series
of registers. One series is a register of letters received from the
Indian Office and each volume is labelled "Commissioner of Indian
Affairs." The particular volume used for the present work covers
the period from December 5, 1860 to January 6, 1866. It will be
found cited as "D," that being a designation given to it by Mr.
Rapp, the person at present in charge of the records. The second
series is a register of letters received from persons other than
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Each volume is labelled,
"Indians."</p>

During the last few years and since the time when most of this
investigation was made, the various files of the Indian Office have
been consolidated and, in many cases, hopelessly muddled. It has
been thought best to refer in the text, wherever possible, to the
old separate files, inasmuch as all letter books and registers were
kept with the separate filing in view.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
